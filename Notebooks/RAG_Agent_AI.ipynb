              "\"lated with the Aryan race also stirred the imagination of the nationalist\\nleaders as well as historians. Though the early orientalists had established connection between\\nSanskrit and certain European languages, Indian scholars now regarded India as the cradle for\\nthe Indo-Aryans who were the fonders of one of the earliest human civilizations. Resultantly,\\nthey pushed back the antiquity of Indian culture. However, the discovery of the Harappan\\nCivilization proved a challenge to the assertions made by such scholars, but R.L. Mitra, R.G.\\nBhandarkar and V.K. Rajvade generally adopted a rational attitude to the past. They were\\nbasically social reformers and against this background of reforms and study of ancient Indian\\ntexts that they made significant contributions to the reconstruction of the political and religious\\nhistory of early Indian. For example, Bhandarkar supported widow re-marriage and denounced\\nthe evils of caste system and child marriage. Rajwade’s study in Marathi on the evolution of the\\ninstitution of marriage is a classic insight on the subject.\\nBut the Indian historical scholars, who were initially inspired by the ideas of social\\nreforms, gradually became anti-imperialist. The spurt in changes on Indian political scene after\\nthe partition of Bengal in 1905 and the awakening of militant nationalism, made a mark on the\\nhistorical writings. The gradual change in historical writings was seen partly as a reaction to the\\nimperialist views of India’s past and partially as an effort to build national esteem. Hindu culture\\nwas looked upon as the precursor of other Asian cultures. The ancient period of Indian history,\\nthus came to be glorified as one of social peace, harmony and prosperity. The age of the Guptas\\nwas considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of ancient India.\\nThe nationalist historians also began to attribute the highest achievements in the field of\\npolitical thought and practice to ancient Hindus. The discovery of Kautilya’s Arthashastra and\\nits publication later in 1909 drew comparison in the social legislation of Bismarck and socio-\\neconomic policies of Kautilya. Ancient Indian tribal oligarchies were equated with Athenian\\ndemocracy. Parallels were also drawn between the constitutional monarchy of Britain and\\nKautilyan kingship. All these writings demonstrated that the tradition of democratic government\\nwas well entrenched into the Indian Political System. These writings sharpened the edge of\\nfreedom struggle. They highlighted the ancient period as glorious overlooking the inequalities\\nand limitations of the past and furthered the struggle of the Indians against the British, thereby\\nproviding an ideological weapon to the freedom movement.\\n3\\nThe nationalist historians, the most important being K.P. Jaiswal, did glorify ancient\\nIndia on the one hand, but on the other their approach to the study of early Indian history and\\nculture was no less unhistorical than that of the British historians. They based their information\\non isolated favourable references from ancient texts and generalized the entire ancient period.\\nThey ignored the changing character of Indian society. In a sense, their writings seem to have\\nbeen influenced by the revivalist ideas of Vivekanand, Dayanand and others. Hindu revivalism\\nalso meant the acceptance of Mill’s periodization of Indian history which was based on the\\nwrong premise that ancient India as seen by nationalist historians meant the glorification of what\\nappeared to them as Hindu India. But these writings ignored the fact that the Indo-Greek, Sakas,\\nKushanas, Mauryans believed in different faiths.\\nWritings of nationalist historians did not evolve a scientific periodization of Indian\\nhistory. They continued to adhere to Mill’s chronological order not realizing the essentially\\ncomposite character of Indian culture. This led to the ruling out of all possibility of a rational\\nbasis of periodization.\\nThe 1950s saw the emergence of Marxist historiography.The main contribution of\\nMarxist scholars was to shift focus from traditional political dynastic history to the study of\\nsocial, economic and cultural history thereby recognizing the effect of socio- economic changes\\non the political developments of the time. Basing their study in conjunction with archaeological\\nand anthropological evidence, elements of change and continuity have been noticed in the early\\nIndian society and economy. Major study in this direction has been made by D D Kosambi in\\n‘An Introduction to the Study of Indian History’ and ‘The Culture and Civilization of Ancient\\nIndia: a Historical Outline’. In an attempt to survey early Indian history, Kosambi thinks that\\nsociety, economy and culture is an integral part of the development of the forces and relations of\\nproduction. It, in other words, means that it is this economic structure on which the socio-\\npolitical superstructure of a society arises, and changes in economic foundation leads to the\\ntransformation of whole superstructure. Basing one’s view point on this theory one could argue\\nthat medieval period did not coincide with the advent of Islam but it was the economic\\ntransformation at the end of the Gupta rule in sixth century CE that marked the beginning of\\nsome important developments in India. The decline of imperial Guptas led to the rise of feudal\\nprincipalities. Volume of trade declined leading to a relatively closed village economy. This in\\nturn led to the surfacing of feudal agrarian set up and emergence of a new socio-economic set-\\nup. Regional cultural units emerged as small principalities as a result of lack of imperial control.\\nThis led to the growth of regional languages, art and architecture. Bhakti or devotion also played\\nimportant role in the newly emerging Indian feudal society. Thus the end of sixth and beginning\\nof seventh century came to be regarded as watershed between the ancient and medieval periods\\nof Indian history.\\n1.2.5 Conclusion\\nOver the last few decades there has been a move towards writing of dynastic history, with\\ngreater emphasis on social, economic, and cultural processes in relation to the political\\ndevelopments. Owing to the various scientific techniques which are now available to the\\narchaeologists for research, there has been a growth in the quantum of archaeological data. This\\n4\\ncombined with new theoretical perspectives, has transformed our understanding of the early\\nIndian past.\\nCheck your progress exercise 1\\nA.

How\\ndid the nationalist reformers and historians attempt to change this perception?\\n1.3 Sources of Ancient Indian History\\n1.3.1 Introduction\\nThe knowledge of India's ancient past can be gathered from literary as well as\\narchaeological sources. Although the art of writing was known as early as the third millenium\\nBCE, our ancient manuscripts are not older than fourth century CE. It was so, not because\\nancient Indians lacked historical sense but because of the fact that the ancient Indians kept\\nrecords of only those aspects which they felt were significant. The political events did not find a\\nsystematic compilation in a chronological order. In the absence of any proper written literary\\nrecords, our knowledge of ancient Indian history and culture is from the archaeological sources\\nnamely inscriptions, coins, monuments and other material remains. Thus, for a better\\ncomprehension of India's past, the evidence from the literary sources has to be corroborated\\nthrough cross-checking with the archaeological evidence. We shall now take up the various\\nsources available to us one by one for the reconstruction of ancient Indian history.\\n1.3.2 Literary Sources\\nThe literature available to us can be classified into two groups namely indigenous\\nliterature which for the sake of convenience can be further sub-divided into religious and non-\\nreligious and foreign literature of the foreign travellers.\\n5\\nIndigenous literature\\nReligious Texts\\nThe ancient Indian literature was mostly religious in nature and was not written with the\\nconscious aim of recording events of the past. The socio-religious scriptures can be classified\\ninto Brahmanical, Buddhist and Jain.\\n\\uf0b7 The Brahmanical Literature\\nThe four Vedas- Rig, Sama, Yajur and Atharva; the Brahmanas; the Aranyakas; the\\nUpanishads; the two Sanskrit epics namely the Ramayana and the Mahabharata; the Puranas\\nand the Dharamashastras constitute the Brahmanical literature. Each Veda has four parts – the\\nSamhita, the Brahmana, the Aranyaka and the Upanishad. The Vedic Samhitas give an account\\nof the life of Aryans in addition to their philosophy, religion, etc. The Brahmanas are the\\ncommentaries and prose explanations of the Samhitas. They mostly deal with the ritualistic\\naspects of religion. They give details of sacrificial rituals and their outcome. The Aranyakas or\\nthe ‘Forest Books’ contains philosophical interpretation of the various sacrificial rituals. The\\nUpanishads, too, form a part of the mystical and philosophical literature and are closely\\nassociated with the concepts of Atman and Brahman. While criticizing the rituals, the\\nUpanishads laid stress on the value of right belief and knowledge.\\nIt is difficult to give Vedas an exact date as they were transmitted orally from one\\ngeneration to another and were not committed to writing until very late.Most historians take\\n1500-1000 BCE as the period of composition of the early Vedic literature and 1000-500 BCE as\\nthat of later Vedic texts. Vedic literature has little trace of political history but gives us a good\\nglimpse of culture and civilization in the parts of north-western and northern India during the 2nd\\nand 1st millennia BCE. We must also remember that almost every Vedic text contains\\ninterpolations.\\nVedanga literature was composed between 600 and 200 BCE in order to assist the\\nunderstanding of the Vedas. Six in number, the Vedangas included works on phonetics (shiksha),\\nritual (kalpa), grammar (vyakarana), etymology (nirukta), metrics (chhanda), and astronomy\\n(jyotisha).\\nThe two Epics –the Ramayana and the Mahabharata – provide significant information on\\nthe economic, religious, social and political conditions of their times. The composition of the\\nMahabharata is placed between 400 BCE and 400 CE. It is believed that originally it consisted\\nof 8800 verses but the final compilation increased the verses to 10,000. Its narrative portion\\nconsisting of Kaurava-Pandava conflict relates to the Later Vedic period; the descriptive portion\\nto the Post-Vedic period; and the didactic portion to the post-Mauryan and Gupta periods.\\nSimilarly, the Ramayana was composed between the 5th century BCE and the 3rd century CE and\\noriginally consisted of 6,000 verses which were increased to 12,000 and eventually to 24,000.\\nThe major Puranas also seem to have been finally compiled by c. 400 CE. The Puranas are\\nencyclopaedic in content associated with different kind of rituals and practices, and also provide\\ndynastic history up to the beginning of Gupta rule.\\n6\\n\\uf0b7 The Buddhist Literature\\nThe religious works of the Jainas and the Buddhists are important sources of history\\nwhich refer to historical persons and incidents. Early Buddhist literature is generally divided into\\ncanonical and non-canonical texts written in Pali. The Pali Tipitikas consisting of three books –\\nthe Vinaya, Sutta and Abhidhamma - fall under the first group. They contain all the basic aspects\\nof Buddhist socio-religious order. Jatakas or the stories of Gautam Buddha's previous births\\nform the most important portion of the non-canonical literature. Besides making incidental\\nreferences to political events in the age of Buddha, the Jatakas throw invaluable light on the\\nsocial and economic conditions of the period between the 5th and 2nd century BCE. Milindapanha\\n(2nd century BCE - 1st century CE), the Pali chronicles – the Dipavamsa (4th-5th centuries CE)\\nand the Mahavamsa (5th century CE) and several other Buddhist works in Sanskrit or mixed\\nPrakrit-Sanskrit such as the Mahavastu, the Lalitvistara, the Divyavadana, Ashvaghosha's\\nBuddhacarita etc. are important sources for the reconstruction of socio-religious, political and\\neconomic history of their times.\\n\\uf0b7 The Jaina Literature\\nThe sacred books of the Jainas, known as the Siddhanta or Agama are also of immense\\nvalue for the study of ancient history. Their final compilation supposedly took place in Vallabhi\\nin Gujarat in the 5th or 6th century CE. The texts written in Prakrit contain information useful for\\nthe reconstruction of political history of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the age of Mahavira.\\nThe non-canonical Jaina works which are partly in Prakrit and partly in Sanskrit tell us about\\nJaina Tirthankaras and also about trade and traders in those times. The Jaina Puranas (compiled\\nin 8th-9th centuries CE) and the Parishishtaparvan by Hemchandra are the part of the Jaina\\nliterature providing important historical data on Jaina religion and culture.\\nNon-Religious Literature\\nThe mass of non-religious literature is comprised of Dharmashastras, biographies,\\nchronicles, works on politics and grammar, classical Sanskrit literature and several scientific\\nworks. It is not possible to mention all, so we shall mention only a few under each head.\\nThe Dharmasutras compiled in 500-200 BCE and the Smritis (circa 200 BCE – 900CE)\\ntogether with their commentaries are called Dharmashastras. Thes are law books dealing with\\nnorms of social behaviour besides personal, civil and criminal law. From them we infer about\\nsocial practices prevalent in those times.\\nThe Buddhacharitaand the Saundaranandaby Ashvaghosha, and Harshacharita by\\nBanabhatta, are some of the important biographies of ancient times. Kalhan's Rajtarangini, the\\n12th century historical chronical of Kashmir is the best example of the earliest historical writing.\\nNoteworthy works on politics and grammar include Kautilya's Arthashastra which\\nprovides rich material for the study of ancient Indian polity and economy. Kamandaka's\\nNitishastra and Panini's Ashtadhyayi provide information about the janapadas or the territorial\\n7\\nstates of pre-Mauryan times. Patanjali's Mahabhashya is a commentary on Panini but also\\nfurnishes accounts of post-Mauryan times.\\nAryabhata's Aryabhatiya and Varahamihira's Brihatsamhita are important astronomical\\ntexts while Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita are renowned works on medicine.\\nOf the ancient dramas, the Dutavakya, Balacharita, Svapna-Vasavadatta by Bhasa, the\\nMudrarakshasa and Devichandragupta by Vishakadatta and the classic works of Kalidasa\\nincluding both kavyas and dramas such as Äbhijnanshakuntalam, Malvika-Agnimitram,\\nRaghuvamsa etc. reflect the social and cultural conditions of the times of which the writers\\nbelonged.\\nBesides the Sanskrit works, we also have some Tamil works constituting the corpus of\\nSangam literature assigned to the early centuries of the CE. The Sangam literature is a major\\nsource of information for the social, economic and political life of the people living in Tamil\\nNadu and Kerala in the early centuries of the CE.\\nA number of dynastic historical chronicles have been found in different parts of Northern\\nIndia. Only some important chronicles are mentioned below. In Gujarat the following well-\\nknown works have been discovered: the Ras-Mala and Kirti-Kaumudi of Somesvara, the\\nPrabandha-Kosa of Rajasekhara, theVasanta-Vilasa of Balachandra etc. These works contain\\nboth fables and facts. In Sind, in early thirteenth century, with the initiative of the Arabs, was\\nstarted the writing of local historical chronicle named the Chachnama. It narrates in details the\\nArab conquest of Sind. Only the translated versions of the Chachnama in Persian have reached\\nus. They also contain the historical background of the century previous to the Arab conquest of\\nSind i.e. the early seventh Century. Local chronicles of Nepal are known as Vamsavalis. Early\\nportions of these works are, “purely mythical”, while the accounts narrated in them since first\\ncentury CE contain some materials relating to history of Nepal as they bear a list of the names of\\nKings with the duration of their reigns. In Assam local chronicles of Kamarupa Sansnavali are\\none of the important sources for reconstructing the history of late Hindu period of Kamarupa in\\nAssam.\\nForeign Literature\\nThe accounts of the foreigners or foreign travellers supplement the indigenous literature.\\nThe identification of Prince Sandrokottas (mentioned by Greek writers as a contemporary of\\nAlexander the Great) with Chandragupta Maurya has served as the sheet anchor in ancient Indian\\nchronology. The works of Arrian, Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy and Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\\nwritten by an anonymous Greek navigator help us in the study of ancient Indian geography and\\ncommerce. The Indika of Megasthenes, an ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya,\\ngives a descriptive account of the administration, society, and economic activities in the time of\\nthe Mauryas. The Greek accounts are not completely reliable as they are based more on hearsay\\nthan on personal experiences of the writer. Also most of the Greek writers were ignorant of the\\nIndian languages which might have affected their impressions and knowledge of our country.\\n8\\nThe best known among the Chinese travellers were Fa Xian (Fa-Hien) and Xuan Zang (Hiuen-\\nTsang) who provide us with useful information regarding the social, religious and economic life\\nduring the reign of Chandragupta II and Harsha respectively.\\nThe Tibetan historian Taranath in his History of Buddhismgives us information about\\nBuddhism and its spread. The accounts of Arab travellers mostly deal with India and its\\ninhabitants and also throw light on trade and aspects of political history. Alberuni's Tehquiq-i-\\nHind describes the socio-economic and political condition of India in the 11th century.\\nCheck your progress exercise 2\\nA.

Name any two texts belonging to each of the following:\\n(i) Buddhist literature (ii) Jaina literature.\\n1.3.3 Limitation of Literary Sources\\nIf we had to rely on literary sources alone, our information would have been incomplete.\\nThe greatest handicap in the study of the history of ancient India is the absence of a definite\\nchronology. But this gap has been filled by actual remains of this period in the shape of coins,\\ninscriptions and monuments. We do not have continuous written records of the past because\\nsome have been destroyed with passage of time. Even the available literary sources, such as\\ncourt literature, foreign accounts etc. may contain different kinds of biases. It is at this stage that\\nthe actual remains of the past come to the rescue of the historians to form a fair and objective\\nassessment of the events that took place.\\n1.3.4 Archaeological Sources\\nAs historical evidence, the archaeological sources take precedence over the literary\\nevidence because, as has already been pointed out, the age and authorship of most of our ancient\\ntexts are uncertain. Also, as a result of various additions and interpolations made over a period of\\ntime, they have undergone modifications. Besides, the account given in the literary sources is\\nmore often coloured with the state of the mind of the author and in order to grasp the real\\nsignificance of the historical events mentioned in these works, it becomes absolutely essential to\\ngive due consideration to the author's point of view while interpreting their statements.\\nArchaeological evidence helps us in solving chronological problems. We often get\\nvaluable proof of date by a careful examination of the stratification of the ruins on ancient sites.\\nImportant excavations at a large number of sites including those at Harappa, Mohenjodaro,\\nNalanda, Taxila, Sarnath, Arikamedu etc. have contributed largely to our knowledge of the past.\\nArchaeology is our only source of knowledge for the prehistoric period. It enables us to know a\\n9\\ngreat deal about the evolution of Indian civilization and a scientific examination of buildings,\\nmonuments, and works of art, throw much light on the social and religious conditions prevailing\\nin ancient times.\\n\\uf0b7 Inscriptions\\nInscriptions constitute the most reliable source of our knowledge of the ancient Indian\\nhistory. The study of inscriptions is called Epigraphy. Being engraved on stone slabs, pillars,\\nrocks, copper plates, walls of buildings etc. inscriptions are neither easily perishable nor can they\\nbe easily tampered with. Majority of inscriptions are commemorative, dedicatory or donative.\\nThey commemorate some particular event, public or private, or record the dedication of some\\nbuildings or images, or bear testimony to grants of land. Although the correct and definite dates\\nare not always mentioned, yet the changing character of the script enables us to determine the\\napproximate age of the inscriptions. The script also indicates the language known in those days.\\nThey are written in different languages, such as Pali, Prakrit, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telegu etc. Before\\nthe Gupta period most of the inscriptions were written in Prakrit. Two types of scripts were\\nprevalent in writing these inscriptions viz., Brahmi and Kharosthi. Most of the inscriptions were\\nwritten in Brahmi, while only a few were written in Kharosthi which was derived from Aramaic\\nand similar to the Semitic alphabet.\\nThe series of deciphered Indian inscriptions open with the edicts of the great Mauryan\\nemperor Ashoka. These edicts are royal commands for regulating social, religious and\\nadministrative behaviour. The edicts of Ashoka on rocks and pillars not only tell us about his law\\nof piety but also enable us to form an idea of the extent of his empire. From the Ashokan\\ninscriptions we come to know about Ashoka's religious policy (Dhamma), administrative system,\\npersonal character, advancement and standards of educational system, the ancient language and\\nAshoka's relations with other countries. Moreover they also throw light on Mauryan art. These\\nwritten records which are mostly in the Prakrit language, were engraved in Brahmi script barring\\na few in the north-west which were engraved in Kharoshthi script written from right to left.\\nThe post-Mauryan and Gupta inscriptions fall into two categories – official and private.\\nThe official inscriptions generally record the royal achievements and are written by court poets.\\nAmong such inscriptions, popularly known as the Prashastis, the most prominent ones are the\\nPrashasti of the emperor Samudra Gupta engaved on the Ashokan pillar at Allahbad, the\\nHathigumpha prashasti of king Kharavela of Kalinga, the Nasik inscription of king Gautami\\nBalsree, the Girnar inscription of king Rudradaman, the Aihole inscription of the Chalukya king\\nPulkesin II, the Bhitri and Nasik inscriptions of the Gupta ruler Skandagupta.\\nThe inscriptions engraved on the copper-plates are available in large numbers. They\\ncontain an account of land-grants made by different rulers. These inscriptions describe the area\\nof land granted and also the date of the grant. Some of them also describe the achievements of\\nthe rulers who granted lands. These inscriptions, besides many more, of private individuals or\\nlocal officers, have furnished us with names of various kings, boundaries of their kingdoms and\\nsometimes useful dates and clues to many important events of past.\\n10\\nPrivate inscriptions are more numerous than the official ones. They are mostly engraved\\nin temples or on images of stones or metals. These have provided us information concerning\\ndates of construction of temples, the development of architecture and sculpture at various places\\nduring different times and also the growth of regional languages. Thus, these inscriptions have\\nbeen of great help in tracing the evolution of art and religion and also in determining the general\\nconditions in any specific period.\\nThe history of Satavahana rulers has been based mostly on their inscriptions. Similarly,\\nthe inscriptions of the south Indian rulers like the Pallavas, the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the\\nCholas and the Pandyas have been of great help in finding historical facts of the rule of their\\nrespective dynasties.\\nCertain inscriptions found outside India throw valuable light on the relations of India\\nwith foreign countries. Ashokan inscriptions clearly indicate that he sent his religious preachers\\nto Burma, Ceylon, the Himalayan Terrai, Egypt, Syria, Macedonia, Greece etc.\\n\\uf0b7 Coins\\nNext to the inscriptions, coins are another important archaeological source of history of\\nancient India. Hoards of gold, silver and copper coins have been unearthed in different parts of\\nthe country which provide us valuable information regarding Indian history till the Gupta age (6th\\ncentury CE). The study of coins is known as Numismatics. Numismatic evidence, though\\ncomparatively less important than its inscriptional counterpart, forms a very authentic source of\\ninformation on certain periods of ancient India. It can be broadly divided into two distinct\\nperiods: pre and post-Mauryan period. Coins in the period prior to the Mauryas are generally of\\ntwo types: the punch-marked coins and the coins cast in die. These coins were issued both by the\\nmonarchical and the republican states, on the one hand, and by private merchants, trade guilds,\\ncity corporations and other small private bodies on the other.\\nThe earliest coins, made mostly of silver and, in a much lesser quantity, of copper, were\\nthe punch-marked coins, which did not contain any name but figures and symbols only. These\\ncoins were made by imprinting symbols on the obverse and reverse by individual punches. We\\nalso come across uninscribed cast copper coins and punch-marked coins with symbols. These\\nwere made by pouring molten metal in casts bearing the negatives of these designs.\\nIt is not till after the Greek invasion that we come across coins with the names of kings\\nclearly engraved on them. The history of the Bactrian, Parthian and Scythian princes in India has\\nbeen reconstructed almost solely on the basis of a careful study of the coins issued by them.\\nThese coins contained the busts and the names of the rulers. A large number of coins of the Saka\\nrulers also contained the dates according to the Saka era thereby enabling the historians not only\\nto draw dynastic lists but also to determine the chronology of the ruling powers.\\nThereafter, plenty of gold coins of the Kushana and Gupta rulers are also available. The\\nKushanas continued the tradition of bilingual (Greek and Khroshthi) inscriptions but their\\ncoinage also displays Iranian and Indian influence. The number of coins belonging to the post-\\nGupta period is severely limited. The coins of great emperors like Harsha or ruling dynasties like\\n11\\nthe Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Pratihara, or Palas, not to speak of lesser kings and dynasties, are\\neither unknown or of little significance.\\nCoins have helped us in finding out the names and dates of various rulers besides helping\\nus indirectly in assessing the economic and religious conditions of the times when they were\\nissued. Some historians have endeavoured to ascertain the economic condition of India at\\ndifferent times by scientifically examining the gold, silver and copper coins issued during the\\nconcerned periods. The coins provide us information about personal traits of the rulers and the\\ndeities they worshiped. Besides giving us an idea about the extent of the empire of a ruler, coins\\ncan enlighten us on the various kinds of art and its development, such as the art of writing, the art\\nof moulding metal etc.\\nMoreover, coins are also a principal source of our information regarding the various\\nIndian states, both monarchical and republican, that flourished during the ancient period. The\\nhistory of the Mitra rulers of Panchala, Malavas, and Yaudehas has been almost exclusively\\nreconstructed on the basis of their coins.\\nFinally, coins in several ways, supplement the information acquired through literature.\\nMany a time, the coins alone have brought to light certain rulers who were not mentioned\\nanywhere in the literature. For example, in our literature, there is a mention of only three or four\\nGreek rulers in India, where as about thirty-three such rulers ruled in India for two centuries.\\nIn addition to coins and inscriptions, we have other archaeological remains in the form of\\nbuildings, pottery, statues of stones, etc. which help us in tracing the history and evolution of\\nIndian art. The excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro tell us that long before the Aryans,\\nthere flourished an advanced civilization in the valley of the Indus. The systematic excavations\\nof the ancient sites like Taxila or the monastic establishments at Sarnath have thrown light upon\\nBuddhist way of life. The stone temples in south India and the brick monastaries in Eastern India\\nstill remind us of the great building activities of the past. The Megaliths reveal the way of life of\\nthe people in the Deccan from the Iron Age onwards.\\n\\uf0b7 Ruined Cities and Monuments\\nThe most important aspect of archaeological source is the large number of excavated\\nruined cities wherein lie a large number of monuments.\\nThe following are the important excavated cities and towns of ancient India, Rajgir\\n(ancient Rajagriha), Vaishali, Nalanda, Bodh Gaya, etc., in Bihar, Peshawar (ancient\\nPurushapura), Taxila etc., in North-western Frontier Province and the Punjab; Ujjain, Sanchi etc.,\\nin Madhya Pradesh; Bairat, Rairh, Sambhar, etc., in Rajasthan; Langhnaj, Patan, Amreli, etc., in\\nGujarat; Kolhapur, Kondapur etc., in Deccan; Chandravali, Brahmagiri etc., in Mysore;\\nAmaravati, Nagarjunakonda etc., in Andhra Pradesh; Virampattanam etc. in Tamil Nadu;\\nMathura; Varanasi, Sravasti, Kausambi, Ahichchhatra, Hastinapur etc., in U.P.; Parihaspur,\\nAvantipur, Martand etc., in Kashmir.\\n12\\nSpecial mention may be made here of the pre-Aryan civilization of Indus Valley,\\nexcavated partly in Mohenjodaro and Chanhu-daro in Sind, and partly in Harappa in the Punjab\\nduring the later phase of British rule in India. With extensive excavations in post-independent\\nperiod, sites have been discovered in a large area consisting North-Western India, Rajasthan and\\nthe Deccan. Mehrgarh excavations deserve a special mention since Mehrgarh, located on the\\nbank of the Bolan river in the Kochi plain (Baluchistan), is the only known Neolithic settlement\\nin the Indian subcontinent, attributed to approximately 7000 B.C.\\n\\uf0b7 Miscellaneous Finds\\nRelics of Indian sculpture and painting, ruins of the Buddhist Stupas and monastaries,\\nimages of Buddhist and Hindu gods and many manuscripts written in Indian languages and\\nIndian alphabets have been unearthed at various parts of Central Asia, China, Korea, Mongolia,\\nJapan, Tibet, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Java and Sumatra, etc Angkor Vat in\\nCambodia and Borobodur in Java testify the spread of Indian culture to these countries.\\nA scientific examination of buildings, monuments and works of art, throws much light on\\nthe social and religious conditions prevailing in ancient times. The wall paintings of Ajanta and\\nEllora caves, different statues of Buddha, clay seals and pots of the Indus Valley are but a few\\nexamples, which point out the artistic skills of Indians in ancient times and help us in discovering\\nancient Indian culture. The temples of Deogarh in Jhansi and Bhitargaon near Kanpur throw light\\non the artistic activities of the Guptas. The excavations at Sarnath have added to our knowledge\\nregarding Buddhism and Ashoka.\\nRemnants have been found in India even of the pre-hiostoric age. These remnants have\\nproved that humans existed in India even during the palaeolithic age. Baluchistan, north-west\\nIndia, Ganga-Yamuna Doab, Madhya- Bharat and south India have yielded remnants of the Iron\\nAge, which help us in tracing the social and economic development of the people at different\\ntimes in different parts of India.\\n1.3.5 Conclusion\\nSumming up, it may be said that the archaeological sources provide us valuable\\ninformation on, political, socio-economic, and religious conditions in ancient India. But writing\\nof an objective and comprehensive history involves a careful examination and correct\\ninterpretation of all the available source material. Therefore, the attempt should be to corroborate\\nthe archaeological evidence with the literary evidence in order to reconstruct a reliable history of\\nour ancient past.\\nCheck your progress exercise 3\\nA.Fill in the blanks\\n(i) The study of coins is known as –---------\\n(ii) –-------- generally record the royal achievements and are written by court poets.\\n13\\n(iii)The earliest coins, made mostly of silver and, in a much lesser quantity, of copper, were\\nthe –-------------- coins.\\n(iv) The study of inscriptions is called ----------.\\n(v) –-----------located on the bank of the Bolan river in the Kochi plain (Baluschistan), is the\\nonly known Neolithic settlement in the Indian subcontinent, attributed to approximately\\n7000 B.C.\\n(vi) –----------- reveal the way of life of the people in the Deccan from the iron age onwards.\\nB.

India exhibits a vast variety of races,\\nlanguages, and regional distinctions which have immensely contributed to the diversity of its\\nhistory. Environment and geographical features had a considerable influence on India's historical\\ndevelopment. We shall now briefly explain the meaning of the terms- region and environment.\\n2.1.1 The Terms –Region, Environment and People\\nRegion is a concept both familiar and useful to fields of knowledge ranging across the\\narts and social sciences. Distinctive resource endowments, climatic features, and plant and\\nanimal life along with the widespread patterns of human occupation, all differentiate the earth’s\\nsurface. This differentiation is the basis for identifying and naming regions. In other words, a\\n‘region’ refers to an area having associated definable characteristics. However, the term ‘region’\\nis a broad concept which is defined differently in various contexts. While classifying the regions,\\na geographer may use expressions such as ‘physical regions’, ‘natural regions’ etc., whereas a\\nlinguist would be more interested in ‘linguistic regions’. Likewise, a sociologist would venture to\\ninvestigate into ‘cultural regions’, ‘caste regions’ etc. These regions can be further divided into\\nsub-regions.\\nHowever, despite the various connotations, the region enjoys a special relevance in\\ngeography due to its popular association with earth’s surface. Thus, regions, by this very fact, are\\ngeographical regions with different characteristics. But it is to be noted that for understanding\\nhistorical processes one has to assimilate the various facts of a region rather than just confining\\nto any single approach. Moreover, these regions do not have fixed boundaries always. Hence, a\\nsocial scientist must use the tool of inter-discipline while delineating regions. Therefore, regions\\nhere will be discussed as a geographical concept with reference to history of India.\\nEnvironment is taken as the surroundings or conditions in which various species\\n(humans, animals and plants) exist and function. We know that history and geography mutually\\ninfluence each other. In other words, History without Geography is incomplete, and cannot be\\nexplained in terms of spatial developments. The term ‘nature’ and ‘environment’ are largely seen\\nas being synonymous. In traditional, pre-industrial societies, generally, the natural environment\\nis described as comprising of elements such as the landscape, rivers, climate and weather,\\nanimals, plants, etc. That is why, the study of geography especially environment helps us to\\nunderstand the history of human impacts on nature and the interactions between human and\\nnature (ecology).\\nPeople have been the prime movers in history. Humankind has adapted itself to the\\nchanging environmental conditions corresponding to different regions since prehistoric past. The\\njourney from the hunter-gatherers to modern humans has followed an evolutionary pattern. It\\nalso becomes important here to draw from the researches with regard to composition of different\\nraces, communities, etc. People too are differentiated in terms of demographic patterns, ethnicity,\\ncultural traits, occupations, etc. by anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, historians, and\\n17\\nother social scientists. Besides, terms such as backward, underdeveloped, primitive, uncivilized,\\netc. have often been used in connection with progressive terminology.\\nThe Indian subcontinent has been the meeting ground of several languages and cultures.\\nThus, the role of people becomes significant for exploring the social formations and transitions\\nin different regions in our ancient past.\\n2.2 Constructing Regions and Environment with Special Reference to India\\nHere, we would discuss the regions with regard to physical divisions. This would reflect\\nhow the regions are classified on the basis of the geographical factors. This alone can justify why\\ndifferent kinds of people and their cultures existed in different regions with different\\nenvironmental conditions. These factors are the major determinants of historical developments.\\n2.2.1 Regions\\nThe Indian subcontinent is spread over six countries–India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan,\\nPakistan and Sri Lanka. It is as large as Europe without Russia. It covers a total area of 4,202,500\\nsquare kilometers. Indian subcontinent is marked by variations in soil types, topographical\\nfeatures, rainfall and climatic conditions, which have given shape to different regions. These\\nregions have their distinct identity on account of their separate language, food, dress, crop\\npattern population density, social structure etc.\\nThe subcontinent can be broadly divided into the following main regions on the basis of\\ntheir physical features. These are:\\n\\uf0b7 The Himalayas\\n\\uf0b7 The Indus Plains\\n\\uf0b7 The Gangetic Plains\\n\\uf0b7 Eastern, Western and Central India, and\\n\\uf0b7 Peninsular India\\nThe Himalayas, the world’s largest mountain range, include extensive mountain ranges\\nwith 95 peaks reaching a height of over 7500 m. These mountain ranges measure about 2,560,\\nkm in length and their breadth varying from 240 km to 320 km. As a great barrier these ranges\\nhave not only checked the intrusions but also protected us from the cold winds coming from the\\nnorth. Nevertheless, the passes have provided access to the invaders, traders, and missionaries\\netc. which resulted in interactions in various spheres. The Himalayas can be further sub-divided\\ninto three main sections: (i) Eastern Himalayas, (ii) Central Himalayas, and (iii) Western\\nHimalayas.\\nThe Eastern Himalayan section extends from Darjeeling to the Assam-Burma ranges. The\\nCentral Himalayan region covers the areas from Bhutan in the east to Chitral at the fringe of the\\ngreat table-land of Tibet in the west. The Indian sections of the Central Himalayas are separated\\nby Nepal into the western and eastern regions. The Hindukush ranges form the westward\\nextension of the Himalayas into Afghanistan. The Karakoram range, which now lies in Pakistan,\\n18\\nis the greatest part of the northernmost Himalayan ranges. This is separated from the Zaskar\\nranges running parallel to the south by the Indus river. Surrounded by these high peaks in the\\nnorth and the Pir Panjal in the southwest lies the Himalayan valley of Kashmir.\\nThe rich Indus plains in the upper part include the areas of Punjab (both India and\\nPakistan). The five tributaries of the river Indus in this region have created a vast alluvial plain\\nearning the name ‘bread-basket’ of the subcontinent. In the east these plains merge with the\\nGangetic delta. The lower Indus valley and the delta constitute Sind. This covers the areas\\nbetween the Baluchistan hills on the north–west and the Thar desert on the south-east. This\\nregion is also gifted with rich alluvial soil suitable for the cultivation of rice and wheat.\\nThe Gangetic plains of northern India were formed by the deposition of alluvium in the\\ntrough facing the Himalayas, and the erosion caused by the rivers. They can be subdivided into\\nthree – (i) Upper, (ii) Middle, and (iii) Lower.\\nThe Upper plains largely include the doab in western and central Uttar Pradesh. The\\nMiddle Gangetic plains correspond to eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. This starts from\\nAllahabad, the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna and the terminal point of doab. The lower\\nplains include the areas of Bengal. These are formed by the alluvial deposition of the rivers\\nGanga and Brahmaputra.\\nThe Eastern Indian region constitutes the coastal plain of Orissa. This is located to the\\nsouth-west of the Gangetic delta and the eastern end of the hills of Central India. Mahanadi is the\\nmajor river which along with other rivers has drained this region since ancient period.\\nWestern India is located on the western end of the Central Indian belt. This corresponds\\nto the modern state of Gujarat. The central peninsula of this region is called Kathiawar or\\nSaurashtra peninsula. The northern Gujarat is a semi-arid region whereas the southern areas on\\nthe western coast are fertile. Rann of Kutch is the low-lying area which turns into a swamp\\nduring the monsoons. The Saurashtra region is close to the Indus and has often served as a\\ntransition zone between Sind and lands farther west. The rivers Narmada, Tapti, Sabarmati and\\nMahi have helped in the formation of the coastal plains by carrying and depositing alluvium\\nbrought from the Central Indian hills.\\nThe Central Indian belt constitutes the areas falling under southern Bihar, Chhattisgarh,\\nwestern Orissa and eastern Madhya Pradesh. It is a hilly region where the elevation of hills is not\\nvery high. But these hills are broken by steep slopes and intersected by valleys. Except the\\nAravallis, all other hills run from east to west. The Aravallis, located in the north-western part of\\nthis region extend from south-west to north-east. The Chhattisgarh plains, drained by the upper\\nMahanadi, is located on the east of this region. Narmada and Tapti are the main rivers of this\\nregion.\\nA larger part of the Peninsular India, in contrast to the alluvial plains of north India,\\ncomprises Archaen rocks. Rocks of this system are the oldest in the world. The oldest rocks\\n(gneiss) in the peninsula are dated at more than 3,100 million years old. The Nilgiris and Palani\\nHills are among the most striking examples. The Eastern Ghats are a second major belt of\\ngneissic rocks. The distinction between the Indian Peninsula in its triangular shape from the\\n19\\nAravallis mountains southward and including Sri Lanka, and extra-peninsular India is\\nfundamental both in terms of their origins and their geological structures. In short, this region\\nincludes the Deccan (meaning “South”) Plateau and the surrounding coastal plains. The coastal\\nplains are broad in the east and extreme south while those in the west are narrow. One can\\nobserve their narrowest stretch between Bombay and Palaghat. The Deccan Plateau is divided\\ninto three major regions which largely correspond to the states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh\\nand Karnataka. The Andhra region is sub-divided into many sub-regions such as Telangana\\n(north-western part of the Deccan Plateau), the coastal plains, Rayalaseema, etc. The major\\nrivers of the peninsula are Narmada in Maharashtra, Krishna and Godavari in Andhra Pradesh,\\nand Kaveri in Tamilnadu. The coastal regions embedded with a number of ports facilitated the\\ncommercial and cultural exchange through the ages.\\n2.2.2 Environment\\nThe natural environment is the primary determinant of different species of plants and\\nanimals that are present in a particular surrounding. Climate, for example, influences site\\nlocation, subsistence and settlement patterns. Moreover, it influences crop patterns of a region.\\nThe environment mainly comprises various elements such as climate, weather, landscape,\\nrivers, animals, plants, etc. However, of these, climate is instrumental in influencing the other\\ncharacteristics of a region. With regard to the subcontinent, the term ‘monsoon’ (“the rains”),\\nwhich implies the seasonal wind reversal, is the dominant feature of the climate. In fact, from the\\nequatorial Maldives to the Mediterranean latitude regions of northern Kashmir, the climate of\\nSouth Asia is dominated by the monsoon. The countries of South Asia include some of the\\nwettest regions on earth as well as both hot and cold deserts.\\nFor understanding the history, it is important to have a brief look at the climatic features\\nof India. India’s regional climates vary from the desert of Rajasthan to the maximum rainy area\\non earth, the Shillong Plateau. Despite its tropical latitude (Tropic of Cancer), India experiences\\nhuge contrasts of both rainfall and temperature from region to region. Though, the terms –winter,\\nspring, summer and autumn- are often used to describe climatic transition in India, but the\\nseasons do not correspond to this progression of seasons in all regions. Factors such as humidity,\\naridity, etc. are also to be seen in relation to the hotness or coldness of the seasons. These vary\\nfrom region to region and affect temperature. However, the climatic transition very much\\ndepends on the arrival of the monsoon, although regional climates are very strongly affected by\\naltitude and physiographical factors, both natural and man made.\\nThe seasonal and regional contrasts in rainfall are more striking than contrasts in\\ntemperature. Southwards from Mumbai, the coastal fringe of the Western Ghats intercepts the\\nsouthwest monsoon winds from May to October, resulting in excess rainfall of 4,000 mm near\\nthe coast. The Western Ghats running parallel to the west coast produce a marked rain shadow\\neffect. As a result, the total rainfall in the interior peninsula measures to rarely exceeding 800\\nmm until the east coast is reached. The rainfall increases towards the northeast producing over\\n1600 mm in West Bengal. Assam has recorded some of the highest rainfall totals in the world.\\nThe Shillong Plateau on an average receives over 20,000 mm of rainfall annually. Delhi in the\\n20\\nnorth records 600 mm annual rainfall whereas the rainfall decreases southwards in Rajasthan\\nmeasuring a total of less than 100 mm.\\nHowever, there are some exceptions to the climatic patterns discussed above. Tamilnadu\\nin southeastern India forms a rain-shadow area of the Western Ghats when the southwest\\nmonsoon brings rain to the west coast. This region receives most of its rain between October and\\nDecember, when the northeast monsoon reasserts itself. On the contrary, a narrow strip of the\\nPunjab, which lies on the foothills or lower slopes of the mountainous region, receives winter\\nrain through depressions in the westerlies which prevail across northern India throughout the\\nwinter. Similarly, the climate of the entire Himalayan region is modified dramatically by altitude.\\nCheck your progress exercise 1\\nA.

Thus, it is important to study the environmental changes over the centuries in\\nrelation to the settlement and subsistence pattern to understand our historical past. Not only this,\\nit is also to be observed that how humans related themselves to the nature in different periods.\\nBut the regions, environment and people should not be studied in isolation from each other. So,\\nour attempt should be to explain them in relation to one another.\\n2.3.1 The Stone Age\\nDuring the Stone Age, we find that the hunter-gatherers depended very much on natural\\nresources. Nature offered them various kinds of edible items like roots, fruits, honey as well as\\nanimals, birds and fish, which could serve as food. So, the way humans acquired their food\\ninfluenced the character of their relationship with nature and also how they viewed nature.\\nMoreover, the type of tools such as the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic tools reflect the\\ntechniques employed to exploit nature according to the needs. The study of animal remains gives\\nan insight into the variations in the pattern of prehistoric faunal exploitation. For example, there\\nwas rise in temperature and the climate became warm and dry in the Mesolithic phase. This\\nclimatic change affected human life and brought about changes in fauna and flora. The\\ntechnology of producing tools also underwent change and the small tools known as the\\n‘microliths’ were used. This was due to the fact that now there was a shift in the pattern of\\nhunting from big animals to small animals and to fishing and fowling.\\n21\\nIn Neolithic period the human communities started producing their own food by\\ncultivating cereals like barley, wheat and rice, and also started domesticating animals such as\\ncattle, sheep and goats for milk and meat as well as the beasts of burden. Scholars have argued\\nthat climatic changes at the time of the withdrawal of glaciers around 8,000 B.C. led to the\\nreduction in the forest cover, thus, leading to a food crisis. This prompted hunter-gatherer\\nsocieties to domesticate animals and cultivate plants. This process, besides other regions of the\\nworld, provided the stimulus for the beginning of agriculture and animals husbandry in the\\nIndian subcontinent. The earliest evidence of this comes from Mehrgarh in the Baluchistan\\nregion of Pakistan, around 7,000 B.C. These changes transformed a nomadic hunter-gatherer into\\na sedentary farmer. This led to the beginning of village settlements and manufacturing of new\\ntypes of tools (neoliths). However, the Neolithic cultures in different regions emerged at\\ndifferent points of time, and their duration were also different. Due to the ecological variations\\nwithin the subcontinent, the crops grown also varied.\\nHere, it is important to note that the Stone Age sites in India are mostly found in the hilly\\nregions or the areas drained by the rivers. This shows that the Stone Age people selected their\\nabode depending primarily on their requirements for stone for their tools necessary for their\\nsubsistence.\\n2.3.2 The Harappan Civilization\\nThe middle of the third millennium BCE saw the rise of an urban civilization, which\\ncame to be called as the Indus or Harappan Civilization (circa 2500-1900 BCE). Though this\\ncivilization was widespread covering a large area of over 1,000,000 square kilometer, majority of\\nthe sites are located in the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra (Sarasvati) region. The main geographical\\nfeatures include the lower Indus Valley, Sindh, and Punjab (now in Pakistan) with four principal\\ntributaries to the Indus namely-the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers. The Sarasvati river is\\nnow a dry riverine system and is called the Ghaggar-Hakra region. To the west of the Indus\\nbasin is the eastern edge of the great Iranian plateau and the Hindukush. Today this area is\\nknown as Baluchistan and the Northwest Frontier of Pakistan. To the east is the Indian Punjab,\\nHaryana, northern Rajasthan, and the Ganga-Yamuna doab of Uttar Pradesh. In premodern times\\nthis area was also a dry cropping area. To the southeast is Gujarat, which comprises of diverse\\nregions from the wasteland of the Rann of Kutch, the pasture and dry farming areas of the\\nSaurashtra peninsula, the sandy plains of North Gujarat to the wet coastal area of South Gujarat.\\nThis region is known for the maritime trade since ancient period. Moreover, the black soil of this\\nregion, with its dry cropping properties, facilitates the cultivation of cotton. The millets such as\\njawar, bajra and ragi are grown during the monsoon season.\\nRecent researches in ethnobiology and paleoclimatic studies have helped in the\\nreconstruction of the environment during the second and third millennia. Most evidence suggests\\nthat there has been no significant change in climate or rainfall since around 9,000 years ago.\\nThough some scholars suggest that a more humid climate existed between 3000 BCE and 1800\\nBCE, some others have suggested that winter rainfall was more abundant in the Rajasthan area\\nbetween 5800 BCE and 1800 BCE. Later, the lakes and other water bodies in Rajasthan dried up.\\nThis suggests greater aridity towards the end of the Harappan phase of the Indus Valley tradition.\\n22\\nHowever these studies are contradictory and the environmental changes observed may\\nrepresent natural fluctuations in a localized physical environment or the outcome of human\\nactivities. In the light of the present state of research we can say that the rainfall pattern then was\\nnot very much different from now. But there would have been better grass and cover. The\\nbiggest difference between the third millennium BCE and today would have been with regard to\\nthe drainage system. The classic example can be that of the Ghaggar-Hakra system, which dried\\nup in later periods. The Indus river also changed its course. The investigations in the course of\\nthe Indus river in the third millennium BCE suggest that the course of this river then was to the\\nwest of Mohenjo-daro. But today it flows to the east of the city. Moreover, the volume of water\\ncarried by the Indus in those days would have been more as today it is distributed through canals\\nand other human made structures.\\nOn the basis of the above assumptions we can draw a picture of the rise, maturity, decline\\nand subsistence strategies of the Harappan civilization. The river plains nurtured the first urban\\ncivilization of the subcontinent. The fertile soil benefited for the cultivation of crops like wheat,\\nbarley, etc. This enabled the civilization to achieve a high standard of living. The agricultural\\nsurplus produced led to the establishment of many towns where the surplus served to promote\\nfurther processing and exchange of materials-artisanal and trade activities. The ports on the West\\nCoast helped the Harappans to trade with distant lands like Mesopotamia and regions of Persian\\nGulf. Some scholars argue that over–utilisation of the natural resources leading to depletion of\\nthe natural vegetation cover and a drier climate led to the collapse of the civilization by adversely\\naffecting its subsistence basis. Moreover, in around 1700 BCE the river Sutlej advanced towards\\nthe western direction to join the Indus and the Yamuna eastwards to join the Ganges. This also\\naffected the Harappan settlements resulting in their decline. Scholars have also considered\\nvarious environmental factors such as the geomorphological occurrences, aridity, etc. leading to\\nthe natural calamities, migration of people, etc. as the causative factors for the decline of this\\ngreat civilization. The sense of ecology is well reflected by the Harappan seals which bear the\\nimpressions of trees like peepal (Ficus religiosa), and animals like rhino, tiger, elephant, deer\\netc.\\nSo, we observe a two way process wherein the environment on one hand provides\\ndirection to the human efforts and on the other, the human efforts influence the environment.\\nTherefore, the changes in environment and shifting of the course of rivers, in some instances, led\\nto the migration of population to other regions, whereas the cutting of trees, in some instances,\\nhelped in the creation of cultivable lands. This further led to the emergence of large settlements\\nwhich subsisted on agriculture.\\n2.3.3 The Advent of the Aryans and the Vedic Period\\nThe advent of the Aryans to the subcontinent too is linked with the environmental factors.\\nAccording to the scholars, there was a very cold and dry climate in Central Asia during the 3rd -\\n2nd millennium BCE. However, from the beginning of the 2nd millennium the Central Asia\\nexperienced severe cold. As a result, the people from southern Central Asia, in around 1500 BCE\\nadvanced in the direction of Indian subcontinent in search of a warmer region or a lesser cold\\nregion. These groups consisted of the people speaking the Indo-Aryan languages. The Vedic\\n23\\nculture originated in the western region including Punjab and developed in the western Gangetic\\nvalley. This shift of the settlements from the earlier Indus Valley region to the eastward was also\\nrelated to the environmental set up. In this context, it is important to note that moving from the\\nwest to east of the subcontinent we find a gradual increase in the average annual rainfall from 25\\ncm to 250 cm. The Indus region experienced the annual rainfall from 25 cm to 37 cm whereas\\nthe western Ganga valley experienced 37 cm to 60 cm of rainfall. This increased from 60 cm to\\n125 cm in mid-Gangetic valley and from 125 cm to 250 cm in the Brahmaputra valley. So, in the\\nwestern region with lesser amount of rainfall, it was possible to clear the forest with stone or\\ncopper implements whereas the strong iron implements were required to clear the thick\\nvegetation of mid-Gangetic valley and Brahmaputra valley. Iron was introduced in India by\\nabout 1000 BCE As the techniques of producing the iron implements were developed in later\\nperiods, it is very natural that the exploitation of natural resources first began in the western\\nregion with lesser rainfall and not so thick vegetation when compared with the eastern regions.\\nThe Vedic people worshipped plants like soma and deities such as Indra (associated with\\nrain and thunder), Varuna (with water), Agni (with fire), Pusan (with cattle), etc. This shows that\\nthey cared for the environment as well as of their requirements. For example, rain, rivers etc.\\nwere very useful for the agriculture and fire helped in the clearance of forests as well as for the\\ndomestic purposes. In the Rig Veda, the river Sarasvati is referred to as a goddess. The agro-\\npastoral communities of the Vedic age also had immense use of cattle and hence worshipped\\ndeities for the protection of their cattle wealth.\\n2.3.4 Post-Vedic Period\\nThe post-Vedic cultures flourished in the mid-Gangetic valley and further. One of the\\nimportant factors for this was their dependence on the use of iron. The settled agrarian life and\\nthe agricultural surplus consequently led to the emergence of the idea of territory and territorial\\nkingdoms (rastra, janapada) in the Vedic period. By the 6th century BCE the process of the\\nemergence of janapadas tended to accelerate. The incorporation of smaller janapadas gave rise\\nto the mahajanapadas. Of the 16 mahajanapadas, Magadha emerged as the most powerful.\\nHere too, the environment played a very significant role. Firstly, the geographical location of\\nMagadha and its capitals, first at Rajgir and later at Pataliputra, was favourable in many ways.\\nRajgir was surrounded by five hills and was called girivraj. This physical feature provided\\nsecurity from the enemies. In the 5th century BCE the capital was shifted to Patliputra, which was\\nlocated on the confluence of the three rivers-the Ganges, the Gandak and the son. Not very far\\nfrom here, the river Ghaghara joined the Ganges. So, surrounded by the rivers on different sides,\\nPataliaputra was like a water –fort (jaladurga). In those days it was not easy to capture\\nPatliputra. Second, the alluvium carried by these rivers created fertile agricultural belt.\\nMoreover, due to the heavy rain in this region and the forests having been cleared, the crops\\ncould be grown without much irrigation facilities. Third, the rich deposits of iron ore were not\\nvery far from the first capital Rajgir. Thus, the Magadhan rulers could make effective iron\\nweapons for their protection. Fourth, the rivers were important means of communication and\\ntrade. Even the Magadhan army could move in all directions following the river. Fifth, the\\nforests in the Magadh region were important source of natural resources and especially elephants\\nfor its army.\\n24\\nNevertheless, in this age of Gautam Buddha (6th – 5th century BCE) there were attempts\\nto create ecological balance through the religious and philosophical teachings. This can be best\\nseen in the concept of ahimsa (non-violence) in Buddhism and Jainism. They criticized the\\nkilling of animals in sacrificial rituals. Buddhism and Jainism promoted the traditions by which\\nprotection was given to various plants, animal species, and various elements of the landscape\\nsuch as groves and ponds. In fact, the Buddha himself is said to have been born in sacred grove\\nfull of beautiful Sal trees dedicated to the goddess Lumbini. Looking at it from another point of\\nview, we can imagine how important the cattle wealth was for the expanding agriculture and the\\nday-to-day life. Buddhist literature emphatically criticized the slaughter of cattle. Later, in the 1st\\ncentury CE the Brahmanical literature also considered the killing of the cows as a sin and warned\\nthe killer of its serious ill consequences. These literary works also mention about the medicinal\\nvalues of trees and plants such as neem (margo), peepal, banyan, tulsi (basil), etc. and advocate\\nfor their protection. This tradition has continued till today and can be observed in domestic and\\nsacrificial rituals.\\nThe mountain passes in the north-west provided passage to the various important groups\\nsuch as the Iranians and Macedonians in the following period. The Khyber Pass was the most\\nimportant in this regard. In 326 BCE Alexander of Macedonia (Greece) invaded India. After his\\nconquest of Iran, he moved on to Kabul and marched to India through the Khyber Pass. As a\\nresult of this, there developed cultural and commercial contacts between the merchants and\\ncraftsmen of both regions.\\n2.3.5 The Mauryan Period\\nThe Mauryan Empire also benefited from its geographical spread and strategic location of\\nits capital Pataliputra. The economic prosperity due to the rapid development in material culture\\nenabled the Mauryan rulers to establish an elaborate system of administration with a large\\nnumber of officials. Moreover, according to Kautilya’s Arthasastra, endowed in the large tracts\\nof fertile and cultivated lands in the Gangetic plains, the Mauryan state was keenly interested in\\nexpanding the frontiers of cultivated tracts further, for example, by colonizing Kalinga.\\nNevertheless, the Mauryans also cared for ecological conservation. The best-known ancient\\nstate-sponsored conservation campaign was undertaken by emperor Ashoka after his conversion\\nto Buddhism. The Asokan edicts advocating his policy of dhamma emphasize restraint in the\\nkilling of the animals and planting and protection of trees.\\n2.3.6 The Post- Mauryan Period\\nFrom about 200 BCE when the Mauryan Empire was on the verge of its decline, there\\ndeveloped widespread contacts between the Central Asia and India. The ruling dynasties like the\\nIndo-Greeks, the Sakas, the Parthians and the most famous Kushanas ruled over different regions\\nof the north-western India. The Kushanas extended their rule from the regions of Central Asia up\\nto a large part of north India. In this period also the plains of the Indus and the Ganges were\\nconsidered important on account of their rich fertile land.\\n25\\nThe Mauryas were succeeded by the Satavahanas in the Deccan. The Satavahanas\\nprobably exploited the iron ores of Karimnagar and Warangal areas, which were being exploited\\nsince the megalithic phase. So, the Satavahanas could produce iron implements suitable for\\ngrowth of agriculture. The Satavahanas and the Ikshvakus, who succeeded the Satavahanas, in\\nthe early 3rd century CE in the eastern Deccan, exploited the mineral resources of the Deccan.\\nThe availability of lead in Andhra region helped in the circulation of lead coins during the\\nSatavahana rule. The Raichur doab between Krishna and Tungabhadra, for its resourceful\\npotential, has been the bone of contention for different powers since the ages.\\nThe thriving internal and external trade facilitated developments in various spheres\\nduring the post-Mauryan period. The ports on the east as well as west coasts promoted the\\ngrowth of trading activities. The important ports on the west coast included Bharuch (Broach),\\nSopara, Kalyan, Chaul, Muziris, etc. and those on the east coast were Tamralipti, Salihundam,\\nKottapatnam, Arikamedu, Kaveripattinam, etc. This further resulted in interactions at various\\nlevels. The commodities of export and import also largely depended on the availability of\\nspecific resources in a particular region. Besides the coastal towns, the growing crafts and\\ncommerce promoted the prosperity of numerous inland centres such as Vaishali, Pataliputra,\\nVaranasi, Kaushambi, Mathura, etc. in north India; Paithan, Dhanyakataka, Amaravati,\\nNagarjunakonda, etc. in Deccan, and Madurai, Uraiyur, Kanchipuram, Karur, etc. in the far\\nsouth. Thus, the coastal regions had a significant role in shaping the history and culture of the\\npeople.\\n2.3.7 The Gupta Period\\nThe Gupta Empire was established in the beginning of the 4th century CE. The\\ngeographical factors also played a crucial role in the material developments during their rule.\\nThe centre of their operations lay in the fertile land of madhyadesha including the modern states\\nof Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They also enjoyed the advantage of possessing the mid-Gangetic\\nbasin under their control. Magadha region, being a part of their empire, provided all the benefits\\neither in the form of iron ore deposits or other natural resources as in the earlier stages of history.\\nIn the 7th century CE the Vardhanas, a feudatory of the Guptas, established their\\nsupremacy over other feudatories. This was all due to the efforts of the great Harshavardhana\\n(606-647 CE) who made Kannauj his capital. Kannauj, which is situated in Farrukhabad district\\nof modern Uttar Pradesh, was located in the middle of the Ganga-Yamuna doab. Moreover, it\\nwas situated on an elevated area which was easily fortifiable as compared to those in plains\\nwhere fortification was more difficult. Thus, the soldiers could move by both land and water\\nroutes to exercise control over the eastern and western regions.\\nNow, we shall turn our attention to the developments in eastern and southern India, and\\nsee how geographical factors added to the process of historical dynamism.\\nIn eastern India the regions of Orissa, Bengal and Assam also witnessed developments. A\\nstrong state under the ruler Kharavela was founded in the 1st century BCE in coastal Orissa or\\nKalinga. The coastal region and the delta of the river Mahanadi promoted cultural developments\\nin the region from where it spread to other regions. Orissa, gifted with many coastal ports, also\\n26\\nmaintained maritime trade with Southeast Asia in ancient period. To revive the glory of the\\nmaritime activities of ancient Kalingans, in 1992 Kalinga-Bali yatra was organized by the\\nDepartment of Tourism, Orissa and Government of India. The Bali Yatra Festival is still\\ncelebrated in Orissa on the Kartik Purnima Day.\\nAncient Bengal also included the modern Bangladesh. We have abundance of source\\nmaterials for the study of Bengal region especially from the 4th century CE. The deltaic portion\\nof Bengal formed by the river Brahmaputra was called Samata. This region was populated and\\nattracted the attention of Samudragupta. Cultural contacts with the Gupta Empire stimulated the\\nspread of civilization in this region. This region too was able to develop an advanced food-\\nproducing economy. The economy based on iron ploughshare, agriculture, wet paddy cultivation\\nand knowledge of various crafts was bound to prosper. Kalidas mentions about the\\ntransplantation of paddy in Vanga (west to Samatata) and we also have references about\\nproduction, which was able to sustain both people and government. This further led to the\\ngrowth of numerous settlements.\\n2.4 South India\\n2.4.1 The Megalithic Phase\\nThe megalithic phase is a unique feature in the history of peninsular India. This was\\ncharacterized by the use of iron. Though the megaliths have been discovered in various regions\\nof southern India, their concentration is in eastern Andhra region and in Tamil Nadu. Their\\norigin can be traced to circa 1000 BCE. The last phase of the megalithic period coincides with\\nthe early historical period in South India. An interesting fact to note here is that the megalithic\\npeople depended partly for settlements and burials, on the hill-slopes. Although they were aware\\nof the use of iron and produced crops like paddy and ragi, the use of cultivable land by them was\\nvery limited. They did not settle on the plains or the low lands due to the thick forest cover. So,\\nthe elevated regions provided shelter to the megalithic communities.\\nLater in around the beginning of the Christian era or a little earlier the megalithic people\\nmoved from the uplands into the fertile river basins and reclaimed marshy deltaic areas suitable for\\ncultivation. This was due to their coming into contact with the traders, Jains, Buddhists and\\nBrahmanas who came from the north. They started wet paddy cultivation in the region and formed\\nvarious settlements. This interaction, however, became very prominent after the 4th century CE.\\n2.4.2 Sangam Age and after\\nIn the context of the Tamil region known as Tamilakam or Tamilaham, the spread of iron\\ntechnology led to the formation of chiefdoms which later evolved into states. The fertile Kaveri\\ndelta was advantageous for the cultivation of rice. Natural resources like the spices from various\\nparts, beryl from Kodumanal, pearl from Korkai, etc. were in great demand by the foreigners.\\nThis promoted trade with the distant lands.\\nThe ports on the West Coast had been trading with the Roman Empire since earlier\\nperiod. But, the discovery of monsoon by Hippalus in the 1st century CE made the circum-\\n27\\nnavigation of Cape Comorin easier. As a result the ports on the Coromandel Coast also gained\\nprominence. The Sangam texts mention a number of ports of the Tamil coast. The mountain\\npasses, especially the Palghat gap connected the ports on the west coast and the Coromandel\\nCoast by the route passing through it. Gradually, there was a shift in the trade from the west to\\nthe east coast. Thus, these physical features helped the region in maintaining contacts with the\\nMediterranean world as well as China, Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka. It is well-known that in the\\nearly medieval period the Imperial Cholas emerged as a great maritime power and some of their\\nrulers led naval expeditions to conquer distant lands.\\n2.4.3 Conclusion\\nFrom our discussion on regions and environment in India relation to the role of people in\\nhistorical developments, it becomes clear that the study of these factors help us to unfold the\\nhistorical process in different periods. The survey of different regions reflects that these regions\\nevolved their distinct socio-cultural traits, leading to the emergence of separate socio-political\\nstructures. Moreover, the developments in different regions were uneven.\\nCheck your progress exercise 2\\nA.

Thus, evidence for such period which precedes “recorded” history comes primarily\\nfrom Archaeology and Anthropology.\\nLet us read now more about the Paleolithic and Mesolithic ages.\\n3.2 Human Origins in South Asia\\nThe humid climate of the Indian subcontinent that results in quick and easy\\ndecomposition of organic material led to India’s absence from the fossil map of the world for a\\nvery long time. While the origin of our species, Homo sapiens, in the cradle of Africa is now an\\nindisputable fact, evidence of our early hominid ancestors in India remained elusive. In the\\n1930s, evidence of an early species – Ramapithecus – was discovered from the foothills of the\\nPunjab Siwaliks. Conclusive evidence for direct human origins came in 1984 from Hathnora,\\nnear Hoshangabad, in Madhya Pradesh, where the Geological Survey of India team led by Arun\\nSonakia, uncovered a fossil of a female who had a cranial capacity between 1155 to 1421 cc.\\nThis fossil has been identified as an evolved homo erectus or a transitional form of Homo\\nsapiens (Chakrabarti 2006: 11-12).\\n3.3 Paleolithic Age\\nPaleolithic era refers to the 'old Stone Age' (Palaeo means old, and lithic means stone in\\nGreek) It started 2.5 million years ago and did not end till about 10,000 years ago. It is believed\\nto be the longest period in human history. The early human used stone as a way of cutting things\\nto begin with and as time went on the humans began innovating. The Paleolithic cultures belong\\nto the Pleistocene geological era and can be divided into three major groups, on the basis of the\\nshape, size and methods of manufacture of the principal artifact types.\\nThe Lower Paleolithic (ranging from about 2 mya to 100,000 years ago, in the Indian\\ncontext) is characterized by pebble and core tools like hand axes, cleavers, chopping tools, and\\nrelated artefact forms.\\nThe Middle Paleolithic (from about 100,000 to 40,000 years ago) is characterized by\\nsmaller lighter tools based upon flakes struck from cores, which in some cases are carefully\\nshaped and prepared in advance using techniques such as the Levallois technique.\\nThe Upper Paleolithic (from about 40,000 to 10,000 years ago) is characterized by yet\\nlighter artefacts, and parallel-sided blades and burins.\\n31\\nRobert Bruce Foote established the science of pre-history in India when in 1863 he\\ndiscovered the first Palaeoliths. Subsequently, in the next two decades many prehistoric sites\\nwere reported in the southern peninsula. But it was only in the 1930s when H.de Terra and T.T.\\nPaterson undertook a detailed survey of Kashmir, Potwar and Jammu areas, that the prehistoric\\nresearch gained importance and a number of archaeologists began focusing their attention on the\\ndiscovery of new prehistoric sites, construction of cultural sequences and reconstruction of\\npalaeo environments. By the 1960s Indian prehistorians could confidently divide the Paleolithic\\nindustries of the Pleistocene (Ice-Age), into Lower, Middle and Upper Paleolithic on the basis of\\nthe shape, size and methods of manufacture of the principal artifact types. We shall now take\\nthem up one by one.\\n(Source: V.K. Jain, Prehistory and Protohistory of India, 2006)\\n32\\n3.3.1 Lower Paleolithic Age\\nThe Lower Paleolithic is characterized by hand axes, cleavers, chopping tools, and\\nrelated artifact forms. The tools were all made by removing flakes from a block or core of stone\\nuntil it reached the required size and shape.\\nBori in Maharashtra is considered to be the earliest Lower Paleolithic site. Lower\\nPaleolithic stone tools have also been found in the Soan valley (now in Pakistan), and several\\nsites in Kashmir and the Thar Desert. These were known as the Soanian industries (while the\\nartifacts found over much of the rest of India were known as Acheulian or ‘Madrasian’) and were\\ndominated by pebble or core tools and characterized as a predominantly chopper/chopping tools.\\nThe Acheulian industries was characterized by bifacially flaked artefacts – hand axes and\\ncleavers – along with denticulates, scrapers, spheroids, and picks amongst other tools. The\\nAcheulian artefacts were made principally on hard and durable quartzites. In the Hunsgi valley\\nof Karnataka, limestone was used; at Lalitpur in Central India, pink granite was chosen while in\\nparts of Maharashtra and Central India basalt was preferred. Belan valley in Uttar Pradesh, desert\\narea of Didwana in Rajasthan, Chirki-Nevasa in Maharashtra, Nagarjunakonda in Andhra\\nPradesh are some of the important sites which have yielded Lower Paleolithic tools. The caves and\\nrock shelters of Bhimbetka near Bhopal also show features of the Lower Paleolithic age. Majority of\\nLower Paleolithic artefacts found in all parts of the subcontinent are made of quartzite.\\nThe rivers – Tapti, Godavari, Bhima and Krishna have yielded a large number of\\nPaleolithic sites. The distribution of Paleolithic sites is linked up with ecological variation like\\nerosional features, nature of soils etc. The Tapti trough has deep regur (black soil), and the rest\\nof the area is covered mostly by medium regur. There is scarcity of Paleolithic sites in the upper\\nreaches of Bhima and Krishna. From Malprabha, Ghatprabha and affluents of the Krishna a\\nnumber of Paleolithic sites have been reported. In Ghatprabha basin in Karnataka, Acheulian\\nhandaxes have been found in large numbers. Anagawadi and Bagalkot are two most important\\nsites on the Ghatprabha where both early and Middle Paleolithic tools have been found. The\\nrivers Palar, Penniyar and Kaveri in Tamil Nadu are rich in Paleolithic tools. Attiranmpakkam\\nand Gudiyam (in Tamilnadu) have yielded both Early and Middle Paleolithic artifacts like\\nhandaxes, flakes, blades, scrapers etc.\\n3.3.2 Middle Paleolithic Age\\nThe Middle Paleolithic industries are characterized by smaller and lighter tools based\\nupon flakes struck from cores, which in some cases are carefully shaped and prepared in\\nadvance. There was an increase in the Levallois and discoidal core techniques. In most regions,\\nquartzites continued to be used, and in such cases, Lower Paleolithic elements continued into the\\nMiddle Paleolithic.\\nHowever, fine-grained siliceous rocks such as chert and jasper, were now preferred for\\ntool-making, and raw material was often transported over several kilometers. Middle Paleolithic\\nhominids largely continued to occupy areas inhabited during the Lower Paleolithic. But, in some\\nparts of India such as Tamil Nadu, rock shelters began to be occupied for the first time. The\\nartifacts of Middle Paleolithic age are found at several places on the river Narmada, and also at\\nseveral sites, south of the Tungabhadra river. The Belan valley (UP), which lies at the foothills of\\nthe Vindhyas, is rich in stone tools and animal fossils including cattle and deer. These remains\\nrelate both to the Lower and Middle Stone Age.\\n33\\nThe Wagaon and Kadamali rivers in Mewar are rich in Middle Paleolithic sites. A variety\\nof scrapers, borers and points have been discovered in this area. Middle Paleolithic artefacts have\\nbeen reported from Chirki near Nevasa and Bhandarpur near Orsand Valley. At Bhimbetka, the\\ntools representing the Acheulian tradition were replaced at a later stage by the Middle Paleolithic\\nculture. By and large open-air sites along streams on hill slopes, stable dune surfaces and rock-\\nshelters continued to be used as is evident from the finds from Sanghao cave in Modern Pakistan,\\nLuni river basin in Rajasthan, the sand dunes of Didwana, the Chambal, Narmada, Son and\\nKortallayar river valleys, the plateaus of Eastern Indian and the Hunsgi valley in the south. Dates\\nfor this period range from around 1, 50,000 to 30,000 before present (BP), a period characterized\\nin general by aridity.\\nPerhaps the most remarkable group of Middle Paleolithic sites in the subcontinent are\\nthose in the Rohri hills of upper Sind. The industry is based upon the large nodules of chert that\\ncap this group of the flat topped limestone hills. These vast expanses of chert were extensively\\nexploited in Middle and Upper Paleolithic times and again in Chalcolithic period; but they\\nappear to have been largely neglected during the Lower Paleolithic and again during the\\nMesolithic, probably for climatic reasons. Extensive spreads of quartzite boulders, cobbles and\\npebbles in the Potwar region in the northern Punjab were used by Middle and Upper Paleolithic\\ntool makers.\\n(Source: V.K. Jain, Prehistory and Protohistory of India, 2006)\\n34\\n3.3.3 Upper Paleolithic Age\\nTowards the end of the Pleistocene, around 30,000 years ago, there was a distinct change\\nin tool types and technology, which could be related to either changes in hunting methods, or to a\\nmore general shift in the utilization of resources, or a response to environmental change. The\\ntechnique of making parallel-sided blades from a carefully prepared core, is an essential basic\\nelement of all Upper Paleolithic industries of the subcontinent, which were contemporary with\\nthe final arid phase. Artifact types include a wide range of scrapers, backed blades, points,\\nchoppers and burins, and regional variability in blade technology and assemblage structure may\\nnow be clearly identified. For the first time, bone tools appear in limestone caves of Kurnool.\\nAlthough aridity restricted settlement in the interior dunes of Rajasthan, elsewhere Upper\\nPaleolithic sites are abundant. Tools were made on a wide range of raw materials and were for\\nthe most part on long thin blades. Evidence for long distance transport of fine grained chert and\\nchalcedony is widespread, testifying to the vast distances traversed by, or interaction between\\nUpper Paleolithic communities. The Upper Paleolithic industries are generally, characterized by\\nparallel sided blades and burins and other lighter artifacts.\\nThe presence of Upper Paleolithic artifacts has been reported in the Thar regions (though\\nthey are more sparsely distributed then those of the Middle Paleolithic), at Sanghao caves in the\\nNorth West Frontiers Province and in the Potwar plateau of the northern Punjab (both in\\nPakistan), from parts of South India, central Gujarat and north-western Kathiawar. An Upper\\nPaleolithic blade and burin industry from a group of sites near Renigunta in Chittoor district,\\nAndhra Pradesh was also found.\\n(Source: V.K. Jain, Prehistory and Protohistory of India, 2006)\\n35\\n3.3.4 Paleolithic Cultures\\nThe faunal remains of the Paleolithic period suggest that the people were primarily in a hunting\\nand gathering stage. The Paleolithic people subsisted on animals such as ox, bison, nilgai, chinkara,\\ngazelle, black buck antelope, sambar, spotted deer, wild bear, a variety of birds, and tortoises and fishes\\nand on honey and plant food like fruits, roots, seeds and leaves. Hunting is reflected as the main\\nsubsistence pursuit in the Rock paintings and carvings found at Bhimbetka.

The\\nhunter-gatherer communities spread rapidly over India. Microlithic industries associated with\\nwhat appear to be the cultures of hunting people, fishermen, pastoralists or people practicing\\nsome form of agriculture, have been found widely throughout the subcontinent.\\n3.4.1 Mesolithic Tools and Sites\\nMicroliths or small stone tools (their length ranging from 1 to 8 cm) comprised the\\nprimary Mesolithic tools owing to a shift in the pattern of hunting: from big game hunting to\\nsmall game hunting, and to fishing and fowling. These microliths were made on blades and\\nbladelets and include burins, lunates, crescents, triangles, points, trapeze etc. which were\\nsubsequently hafted onto bone or wooden handles to form composite tools. Mesolithic sites\\nabound in Rajasthan (Bagor, Tilwara, etc.), Uttar Pradesh (Sarai Nahar Rai, Morhana Pahar,\\nLekhahia etc.) Central India (Bimbetka, Adamgarh etc.) eastern India (Kuchai in Orissa,\\nBirbhanpur in west Bengal, Sebalgiri-2 in Garo hills of Meghalaya etc.) and also south of the\\nriver Krishna (Sangankallu, Renigunta etc.) There is a rich concentration of microlithic sites in\\nthe Narmada, Mahi and Sabarmati valley of Gujarat.

Scholars have long debated the onset of\\nthis fundamental, lifestyle altering development in human prehistory – what was the catalyst that\\nmoved humans in vastly separated parts of the world to adopt agriculture and animal\\n41\\ndomestication? While convincing hypotheses have been put forward for all three schools of\\nthought, it is today generally agreed that it was a combination of all the three factors i.e. climatic\\nchanges at the beginning of the Holocene, increasing population density and evolving cultural\\nand technological strategies of human groups that ushered in this transformation.\\n4.2 Significance of Food Production in World Context – Characteristic Traits of the\\n‘Neolithic’.\\nWhat is it about the Neolithic that it is at once, the last leg of the Stone Age and also the\\nlink or platform on which all subsequent civilizations arose? That it is a Stone Age culture can be\\nestablished by the use of stone tools. But unlike the lighter and sharper tools of the Palaeolithic\\nor Mesolithic, the Neolithic tool kit was composed of heavy ground tools – pestles, mortars,\\ngrinders and pounders – as also axes and sickles which have a characteristic sheen on them, the\\nresult of harvesting wild or domesticated plants and grasses.\\nAlthough the Neolithic people used stone tools like their predecessors, yet they had little\\nin common with them. The Palaeolithic and Mesolithic humans were mobile hunter-gatherers\\nwho travelled long distances to procure their food. On the other hand, Neolithic populations all\\nover the world relied on agriculture or food production and the domestication of animals for their\\ndietary needs. Interestingly, all of the largest and most complex civilizations throughout history\\nhave been based on the cultivation of one or more of just six plant genera – wheat, barley, millet,\\nrice, maize and potatoes and these have thus been called the main ‘engines of civilizations’.\\nSedentary life is another feature that distinguishes the Neolithic period. Somewhere between\\n10,000 and 3,500 years ago, people all over the world, without any apparent connection, began\\nsettling down in agricultural communities and gave rise to villages, towns and then cities.\\nThe use of pottery and the wheel and the subsequent invention of crafts like spinning,\\nweaving and bead-making also serve to demonstrate the uniqueness of the Neolithic phase. Most\\nNeolithic cultures start as aceramic or pre-pottery Neolithic. However, soon enough, sherds of\\nhand-made pottery are found, often followed by wheel-thrown pottery. The technological\\nbreakthrough of the wheel enabled developments like spinning and by the time of the Bronze\\nAge civilizations, the use of the wheel in carts.\\n4.2.1 The idea of the Neolithic and ‘Neolithic Revolution’\\nThe term Neolithic was coined by the Danish prehistorian Thomsen in the 1860s to\\ndistinguish the ground tool usage of the sedentary Neolithic people from the markedly different\\nand lighter stone tools used by the mobile hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic age. It was a\\nconsideration of the fundamental, subsistence altering developments that made the prehistorian\\nGordon V. Childe designate this phase as the ‘Neolithic Revolution’. However, his critics were\\nquick to point out that the term ‘revolution’ is synonymous with sudden or abrupt change, often\\naccompanied by bloodshed and that the Neolithic was a gradual unfolding of developments, the\\nculmination of the Stone Age. While the significant socio-economic impact of the Neolithic\\ncannot be denied, it is today generally viewed as a ‘transformation’ or ‘evolution’ rather than a\\n‘revolution’.\\n42\\nThe second point in Childe’s hypothesis, which has direct bearing on the advent of the\\nNeolithic in the Indian subcontinent, is the presumption that farming was first invented in a\\nsingle ‘nuclear region’ – the Fertile Crescent in Mesopotamia or the Near-East from where it\\nspread or was diffused to other parts of the world. This diffusionist paradigm propounded that\\nthe ‘idea’ of agriculture arose here and then spread to other regions depending on their proximity\\nto this core region.\\nCheck your progress exercise 1\\nA.Write short notes:\\n(i) Characteristic traits of the ‘Neolithic’\\n(ii) Gordon Childe's Hypothesis\\n4.3 Review of Onset of Agriculture in India – Shift from Diffusionist Paradigm to\\nIndependent Developments Leading To Food Production in Different Parts of the Country.\\nIndia was, for a long time, seen as having borrowed the idea of food production from its\\nwestern neighbour, Mesopotamia, via the Iranian plateau. Modern research on the subject,\\nespecially since the 1970s, has discredited this viewpoint. It is now generally believed that\\nagriculture in India was an independent, indigenous development rather than an import from\\noutside. It has been proved for three of the main staples of the subcontinent – the discovery of\\nwheat and barley in Mehrgarh, Pakistan grown almost contemporaneously with the Fertile\\nCrescent sites cancels the possibility of diffusion into India. Similarly, the discovery of rice\\ndomestication from Lahuradeva and Koldihawa in Uttar Pradesh and millet from sites in South\\nIndia has put a question mark on the diffusion of these two crops from South China and South\\nAfrica respectively.\\nThe occurrence of food production in India was spread over a few millennia – from the\\n8th millennium BCE to circa 1000 BCE. A Neolithic celt was discovered as early as 1842 by Le\\nMesurie in the Raichur district of Karnataka, and later by John Lubbock in 1867 in the\\nBrahmaputra valley of Upper Assam. Today, as a result of vast explorations and excavations, the\\ndistribution and nature of the Neolithic in the subcontinent has been brought to light. Some\\nscholars, like R.S.Sharma, divide the Neolithic settlements into three groups – northwestern,\\nnortheastern and southern, based on the types of axes used by the Neolithic settlers (Sharma\\n2005:59). Others, for e.g., V.K. Jain, argue for as many as six different geographical regions,\\neach with its own distinctive features and chronological time-span. These regions are, (i)\\nNorthwestern i.e. Baluchistan and its adjoining area in Pakistan (7th to mid - 4th millennium\\nBCE), (ii) Northern i.e. Kashmir Valley (2500-1500 BCE), (iii) Central India, i.e., Vindhyan\\nregion, south of Allahabad (4000 BCE-1200 BCE), (iv) Mid-Gangetic basin, i.e., eastern U.P.\\nand Bihar (2000 BCE–1500 BCE), (v) Eastern India, i.e., Bengal, Orissa and Assam, (vi)\\nPeninsular or South India, i.e., Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu (2500 BCE–1500\\nBCE).\\nAn overview of the above time frame will indicate that the Neolithic phase in India did\\nnot develop everywhere at the same time nor did it end simultaneously. In fact, there were many\\n43\\nNeolithic cultures which were coexisting with the copper using, urban Harappan Civilization\\n(2600-1900 BCE). These cultures, besides having different time frames, exhibit some regional\\nvariations too. For example, in the northeast region, Neolithic tools have been found but there is\\nno evidence so far of plant cultivation. Similarly, while most of the Neolithic cultures evolved\\nout of the preceding Mesolithic cultures, no such evidence is reported from the Kashmir Valley.\\nBone tools have only been recovered from sites in Kashmir and from Chirand in Bihar and in\\nterms of cereal consumption, while wheat and barley predominate in Mehrgarh in Pakistan, it is\\nrice from Central India and millet and ragi cultivation from the South Indian Neolithic sites (Jain\\n2006: 78-79).\\nThe corpus of evidence gathered so far suggests that while each region responded to its\\nspecific geographical setting, the tapestry that finally emerged had distinct parallels. This was the\\nrise and growth of agriculture and the beginning of settled village life. In the next part, we shall\\ntry to understand the dynamics and nature of this massive change in human lifeway across the\\nlength and breadth of the country\\n4.4 Regional Distribution of Neolithic Cultures\\n4.4.1 North-West India\\nComprising the province of Baluchistan and the Indus plains in Pakistan, this area\\nrepresents the earliest evidence of the Neolithic Culture in the subcontinent, indicated by the\\ngrowth of farming and animal husbandry. Basically, an inhospitable mountainous region, with a\\nclimate of extremes, Baluchistan has nevertheless revealed many traces of early settlements in its\\nvalley pockets.The important sites are Mehrgarh in the Kachhi plain, Kili Gul Muhammad in the\\nQuetta Valley, Rana Ghundai in the Loralai valley and Anjira in the Surab valley.\\nThe Indus plains provide a sharp contrast in the archaeological setting from that of\\nBaluchistan. The lifeline of the area, the Indus is a highly unstable river, which flows through a\\nwide alluvial flood plain. Neolithic sites start appearing in the North-West Frontier Province –\\nGumla, Rehman Dheri, Tarakai Qila and Sarai Khola; Jalilpur in Punjab.\\n\\uf0b7 Mehrgarh\\nThe earliest evidence of agricultural life based on wheat, barley, cattle, sheep and goat in\\nthe subcontinent comes from the site of Mehrgarh on the bank of the Bolan river in the Kachhi\\nplain of Baluchistan. Its convenient chronological point is circa 7000 BCE. For the next two to\\nthree millennia the evidence of this type of agriculture seems to be limited to Baluchistan,\\nalthough by the end of this period it is found spread all over its major areas (Chakrabarti 1999:\\n117).\\nMehrgarh is essential for any discussion on the Neolithic, not only because it has yielded\\nthe earliest evidence for this phenomenon in South Asia but also because the inter-disciplinary\\nand scientific approach to the excavations and the regular publication of the results have\\nprovided us with a very clear picture of the Neolithic way of life there.\\n44\\nExcavations at the site began in 1974 under the leadership of J.F. Jarrige and continued\\ninto the 1980s and later. These have revealed an uninterrupted continuity in the growth and\\nconsolidation of village life in the area. Spread over about 200 hectares of land, this imposing\\nsite bears evidence of occupation in different periods, having been given separate numbers, such\\nas MR 1, MR 2, MR 3 etc. In all, there are seven periods of which only the first three, I-III, are\\nregarded as Neolithic. The time frame for each of these is as follows: Period I from 7000-5500\\nBCE; Period II, from 5500-4500 BCE; and Period III, from 4500-3500 BCE.\\nThe earliest level of occupation, Period I, marks the transition from nomadic pastoralism\\nto agriculture. It was an aceramic level with stone tools consisting of polished axes, chisels,\\nquerns and microliths and bone tools comprising awls, needles etc. The Neolithic character of the\\nsite is reflected in bones of cattle, sheep and goat, indicating their domestication as also the\\nbones of water buffalo, which is the earliest instance of the domestication of this animal in the\\nsubcontinent. Evidence of plant domestication comes from the charred seeds of wheat and barley\\nas also Indian jujube (ber) and dates. The beginning of sedentism can be gleaned from\\nfoundations of mud-brick houses and small cell-like compartments which might have been used\\nfor storage of grains. But perhaps the most surprising piece of information concerns long\\ndistance trade and craft production. As part of grave goods were found, turquoise beads,\\nprobably from the Nishapur mines of Iran; shell bangles, with the seashell being from the\\nArabian Sea coast and beads of lapis lazuli, procured from the Badakshan region of Afghanistan.\\nThis clearly demonstrates that the Neolithic people of Mehrgarh, Period I, were not an isolated\\ncommunity but engaged in exchange activities with other contemporary cultures.\\nPeriod II is characterized by an intensification and diversification of the economic base.\\nSome coarse handmade pottery is found in the lower levels which becomes plentiful in the later\\npart of the period. Towards the end, wheelmade and painted, as well as basket marked sherds are\\nfound having parallels with Kili Gul Muhammad I in the Quetta Valley. Houses became larger\\nand one structure on the site has been termed a ‘granary’. The stone industry continued, with the\\naddition of ‘sickle’ like tools, substantiating the agricultural basis of the economy. Charred\\ncotton seeds indicating cotton plantation and perhaps, spinning and weaving; ivory-making,\\npresumably from an elephant tusk bearing groove marks; terracotta human figurines; a steatite\\nworkshop and beads of lapis lazuli and turquoise, all testify craft production, trade and the core\\nNeolithic stage of human evolution.\\nPeriod III at Mehrgarh, spanning from 4500 to 3500 BCE, represents the final stage of\\nthe Neolithic phase. Surplus production was achieved through a consolidation of agriculture and\\nanimal rearing activities. Vast quantities of pottery have been found, many of which bear painted\\nmotifs, which particularly in the later stages of this period, resemble those of Kili Gul\\nMuhammad II and III. The continuity in the long distance trading pattern can be assessed from\\nthe beads of lapis lazuli, turquoise and fragments of conch shell. Copper objects found on the\\nsurface and traces of the metal found in crucibles suggest that the Neolithic people of Mehrgarh\\nwere familiar with copper smelting. A picture of continuous growth of village life also emerges\\nfrom a number of collective graves that appear in this period and indicate an increase in\\npopulation.\\n45\\n\\uf0b7 Kili Gul Muhammad\\nThe site of Kili Gul Muhammad in the Quetta Valley was excavated from 1949-51 by the\\nAmerican Archaeological Mission headed by W.A. Fairservis, Jr. The first three levels of\\noccupation are ascribed to the Neolithic period. Beginning as an aceramic site around 5500 BCE\\nor earlier, its inhabitants lived in wattle-and-daub and/or mud houses. Animal remains of cattle,\\nsheep, goat, and horse/wild ass have been found and the tool kit comprises microliths, a few\\nground tools, bone points and spatula. The transition from Period II to Period III can be\\ndiscerned from the evolution of a crude, handmade and basket-marked pottery to a fine\\nwheelmade black-on-red ware with simple geometric designs.\\n\\uf0b7 Rana Ghundai\\nSituated in the Anambar valley, Rana Ghundai lies in the ecological transitional zone\\nbetween the Baluchi hills and the Indus plains. The Rana Ghundai sequence was established,\\nafter brief excavations, by Brigadier E.J. Ross in 1946. Periods I-III belong to the Neolithic\\nphase and lasted from 4500 to 3100 BCE. The remains of Period I attest the presence of ‘a semi-\\nnomadic community’ and consist of handmade plain pottery, bones of domesticated animals like\\nox, sheep, goat and maybe a wild ass. A mixed tool kit, of stone and bone, comprised of\\nmicrolithic chips and blades and bone points and eyed needles. Developments in pottery fabric,\\nshapes and designs continued as the Neolithic became a well-established phenomenon here, a\\nway of life.\\n\\uf0b7 Gumla\\nThe site of Gumla in the Gomal valley began as a small, one-acre encampment. Period I\\nis aceramic and shows microliths, domesticated cattle bone, and large shallow pits used for\\ncooking/roasting. Period II has a wide range of painted wheelmade pottery, microlithic tools, a\\nlimited amount of copper and bronze and terracotta bangles, gamesmen, toycarts and cattle and\\nfemale figurines (Chakrabarti 1999: 138).\\n\\uf0b7 Rehman Dheri\\nA large site, spread over more than 20 hectares, Rehman Dheri shows a clear transition\\nfrom the Neolithic to the Kot Dijian and finally the Indus civilization phase. The site is fortified\\nright from the beginning, with a 1.2 m wide mud and mud brick wall. Remains of wheat, barley,\\nfish and domesticated cattle, sheep and goat give us clues as regards their diet. Pottery was used\\nfrom the very first settlement at the site and most of the pottery specimens are of Kot Dijian\\nforms and designs. The calibrated date range of Rehman Dheri is circa 3400-2100 BCE.\\n\\uf0b7 Amri\\nA prominent pre-Harappan site in Sind, Amri is located at the edge of a cultivated\\nalluvial plain, 2 km of the right bank of the Indus. Period I begins with a typical handmade\\nred/beige pottery with geometrical designs painted in black and often with red fillings. People\\nlived in mud-brick houses and domesticated remains of cattle, sheep, goat and donkey have been\\n46\\nfound. Pieces of copper, shell, terracotta bangles, sling stone and parallel-sided blades are other\\narchaeological remnants collected from the site. The Neolithic period of occupation, starting in\\nthe early to mid - fourth millennium BCE was followed by an intermediate phase and finally the\\nIndus civilization phase.\\n(Source: V.K. Jain, Prehistory and Protohistory of India, 2006)\\n4.4.2 North India\\nEvidence for the north Indian Neolithic cultures comes mainly from the Kashmir Valley\\nand is represented by a large number of sites above the flood plains of River Jhelum. The three\\nprincipal sites of the area are: Burzahom, northeast of Srinagar; Gufkral, southeast of Srinagar\\nand Kanishkapura or modern Kanispur, in the Baramulla district. All three are multi-cultural\\nsites, where prolific Neolithic remains are followed by evidence of megalithic and historical\\nperiods. An important feature of the northern Neolithic is the absence of a preceding\\n47\\nmicrolithic/mesolithic phase and the development of this phenomenon occurred between 3500-\\n1500 BCE.\\n\\uf0b7 Gufkral\\nLiterally meaning, the ‘cave of the potter’, the site of Gufkral, started as an aceramic\\nNeolithic site, probably around 3000 BCE and matured into a full fledged Neolithic site. From\\nPeriod IA were discovered large dwelling pits surrounded by storage pits and hearths and with\\npost-holes around the mouths of the pits and hearths. Remains of domesticated sheep and goat as\\nwell as barley, wheat and lentil along with wild sheep, goat and cattle, deer, ibex, wolf and bear\\nindicate the transition from a hunting-gathering to a food producing economy. Polished stone\\ntools, including a large quern, bone/horn tools, steatite beads and a terracotta ball make up the\\nrest of the archaeological repertoire. Periods IB and IC witnessed an intensification of the\\nNeolithic – handmade crude grey ware followed by wheelmade pottery, abundance of stone\\nquerns, pounders, double-holed harvesters etc along with domesticated sheep, goat, cattle, dog\\nand pig.\\n\\uf0b7 Burzahom\\nThe Neolithic people of Burzahom, beginning with Period I around 2700 BCE, lived in\\ncircular or oval-shaped lakeside pit dwellings and subsisted on ahunting and fishing economy,\\nbeing familiar also with agriculture. The sides of the dwelling pits were plastered with mud and\\nboth ladders and steps were used to get inside the large pits. Storage pits containing animal\\nbones, stone and bone tools have been found close to the dwelling pits. The site has yielded\\nmostly coarse and handmade grey, buff and red pottery. The bone industry at Burzahom is most\\ndeveloped of all the Neolithic cultures of India and comprises harpoons, needles, arrowheads,\\nspear-joints, daggers etc. Another distinctive feature is the burials – graves, both of humans and\\nanimals, especially dogs, have been found. Sketchy evidence for ritual practice can be gathered\\nfrom stone slabs depicting hunting scenes, or another representation of the sun and a dog. Two\\nfinds from Period II, dated around second millennium BCE show contact with the Indus plains –\\na pot with carnelian and agate beads and another pot which bears the Kot Dijian ‘horned deity’\\nmotif.\\n\\uf0b7 Kanishkapura\\nKanishkapura or modern Kanispur, a prolific Neolithic and historical site in the\\nBaramulla district of Kashmir, was excavated by B.R. Mani in 1988-89. The Neolithic remains\\nwere excavated in KNP-1 and KNP-2 areas and begin with an aceramic Neolithic layer from\\nwhich a polished stone celt was found. The consolidation of Neolithic activities can be inferred\\nfrom the ceramic Neolithic level or Period II. Four successive floor levels along with post-holes\\nwere excavated at KNP-1 and are part of rectangular houses, which probably had thatched roofs.\\nThe tool kit comprises five bone points and six polished stone celts. Pottery, both handmade as\\nwell as wheel-turned has been found and fine grey ware of medium to thick fabric, coarse grey\\nware, red ware and plain and burnished black ware are the important types. Consumption of\\nemmer wheat mingled with barley has been recorded as also domesticated sheep and goat. The\\n48\\nnew evidence of radiocarbon dates puts Period I around the middle of the fourth millennium\\nBCE and Period II to the late fourth millennium BCE.\\n4.4.3 Central India\\nThe focus of the Central Indian Neolithic is, broadly speaking, the Vindhyan and Kaimur\\nhill ranges of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh i.e. the area, having as its periphery River\\nGanges in the north and River Son in the south. The important Neolithic sites are Koldihawa and\\nMahagara in Allahabad district, Sinduria in Mirzapur district and Kunjun in the Sidhi district of\\nMadhya Pradesh. The dating of the Neolithic horizon for this area remains problematic – some\\nsuggesting the beginning of the Neolithic culture at Koldihawa to circa 6000 BCE, while others\\nassign it to a time range of 4000 –2500 BCE or 3500-1250 BCE.\\n\\uf0b7Koldihawa\\nSituated in the Belan valley of Uttar Pradesh, Koldihawa has a rich prehistoric sequence\\ndown to the Mesolithic phase. The site’s claim to fame is the earliest evidence of rice –\\n‘Domesticated rice comes from the earliest, metal-free level of Koldihawa and occurs in a\\ncontext of wattle-and-daub houses, polished stone celts, microliths and three types of handmade\\npottery – cord marked and incised ware, plain red ware with ochre slip on both sides and a crude\\nblack-and-red ware. Rice occurs as husks embedded in the clay of the pottery’ (Chakrabarti\\n1999: 205-207). The overlap of the microlithic and the Neolithic is testified by the presence of\\nblades, flakes, lunates as well as polished and ground axes, celts, querns and pestles. Evidence of\\nanimal husbandry comes from the bones of cattle, sheep, goat and deer and fishing can be\\ngleaned from the bones of turtles and fish. G.R. Sharma has dated rice cultivation at Koldihawa\\nto around 5500 BCE. Other scholars like F.R. Allchin and D.K. Chakrabarti feel that these dates\\nneed to be re-examined on the basis of fresh evidence. But consensus seems to be growing that\\nrice cultivation was an indigenous, post – “Ice-Age” phenomenon that occurred independently in\\nCentral India and in Koldihawa can be dated to the fifth millennium BCE.\\n\\uf0b7Mahagara\\nAlmost contemporaneous with Koldihawa, the site of Mahagara has yielded some bone\\nimplements along with a tool kit of Mesolithic and Neolithic tools made of materials such as\\nchalcedony, agate, quartz and basalt. This site has also reported a cattle pen, which indicates the\\ndomestication of cattle. The pottery used by the Neolithic folk was handmade and poorly fired;\\nwith straw and rice husk being used as tempering agents. The principal pottery type is the corded\\nor cord-impressed ware though sometimes incised designs are also seen.\\n4.4.4 Mid-Gangetic Basin\\nCovering the areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the mid-Gangetic basin\\nencapsulates the Ganges in its expansive, midstream flow, carrying along with it, the drainage of\\nits tributaries like the Saryu and the Ghaghra. Predictably then, most of the Neolithic sites\\ndotting the area are found on banks of rivers and streams – Narhan, on the banks of River Saryu;\\nImlidih, on Kuwana stream; Sohagaura, on the banks of River Rapti; Chirand, on the banks of\\n49\\nRiver Ghaghra; besides other sites like Teradih and Senuwar. Chirand, considered to be the\\nrepresentative site of the area has revealed a cultural assemblage going back to the Neolithic\\nphase, dated from 2100 to 1400 BCE.\\n\\uf0b7 Chirand\\nThe one kilometer long mound of Chirand lies at the confluence of the Sarayu and the\\nGanga and according to D.K.Chakrabarti, the beginning of occupation at the site may even be\\nearlier than the middle of the third millennium BCE. From Period I or the Neolithic deposits of\\nChirand have been recovered coarse earthenware, comprising red, grey and black handmade\\nwares, some with post-firing painting and graffiti. Terracotta objects including figurines of\\nhumped bull, birds, snakes and bangles, beads, sling balls etc. have been found.\\nPeople lived in circular and semi-circular wattle-and-daub huts with post-holes and\\nhearths. For subsistence, they relied on plant cultivation and animal domestication. Among the\\ncrops are rice, wheat, barley, moong and lentil – which may indicate the raising of two crops a\\nyear, winter and autumn. Animal remains include a wide range from domesticated cattle to\\nelephants and rhinoceros.\\nChirand is the only other site in the country, besides Burzahom in Kashmir that has given\\na substantial range of bone and antler objects such as needles, scrapers, borers and arrowheads.\\nBone ornaments like pendants, bangles and earrings have also been discovered. Stone tools\\nconsist of microliths, Neolithic axes and other implements, such as stone pestles and querns.\\nEvidence of beads made of agate, carnelian, jasper, steatite, faience etc. and also the rich\\nterracotta, bone and antler assemblage mentioned above suggest a movement towards craft\\nproduction and possibly, exchange of commodities.\\n4.4.5 Eastern India\\nEastern India comprises the states of Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha and the\\nNeolithic here caps a rich prehistoric past. Important sites include Kuchai and Golbai Sasan in\\nOdisha; Pandu Rajar Dhibi, Bharatpur and Mahisdal in West Bengal; and Barudih in Jharkhand.\\nSince no rigorous excavations have been undertaken, only a tentative picture of the Neolithic\\nway of life can be hinted at and dating too remains a problem.\\n\\uf0b7 Kuchai\\nThe existence of a Neolithic level at Kuchai near Mayurbhanj in Odisha was established\\non the basis of polished stone tools like celts and axes. At Kuchai the deposit was about 40 to 45\\ncm thick and limited excavations encountered a gritty red handmade ware associated with\\nNeolithic tools including mace-heads, pounders, and grinding stones (Chakrabarti 2006: 258).\\n\\uf0b7 Golbai Sasan\\nThe site of Golbai Sasan situated on the left bank of River Mandakini was excavated\\nbetween 1990-92. Period I at the site is Neolithic and shows a range of dull red and grey\\n50\\nhandmade pottery with cord or tortoise shell impressions in association with a few worked pieces\\nof bone and traces of floors and post-holes (Chakrabarti 1999: 239).\\n\\uf0b7 Pandu Rajar Dhibi\\nPandu Rajar Dhibi in the Ajay Valley was the first site to clearly demonstrate the\\nNeolithic base of later developments like the Chalcolithic. Excavations at the site link Period I of\\noccupation to the Neolithic phase. This is characterized by a handmade grey ware with rice husk\\nimpressions, painted red pottery, some sherds of black-and-red ware, ground stone tools,\\nmicroliths and bone tools. The coexistence of microliths and ground stone tools and bone tools\\nreveals the emergence of the Neolithic from an underlying Mesolithic matrix.\\n\\uf0b7 Barudih\\nThe state of Jharkhand basically lies furled in the contours of the Chhotanagpur plateau.\\nThe first archaeologically identifiable village level in the plateau is represented at Barudih in\\nSinghbhum district. Archaeologists have obtained from the same level, microliths, Neolithic\\ncelts, iron slag and implements and a range of wheelmade pottery among which black-and-red\\nware seems to be prominent. The earliest calibrated time range for the site is 1401-837 BCE\\n(Chakrabarti 1999: 243).\\n4.4.6 North-Eastern India\\nThe entire northeastern region has yielded a rich haul of polished Neolithic tools but no\\nconsolidated picture of a Neolithic level has yet emerged. The spread of the Neolithic is\\nconsidered by some to be an import from South East Asia on account of the use of shouldered\\naxes and also cord-impressed pottery, which has close affinity with the pottery from China and\\nSouth East Asia. On the basis of this link, D. P Agrawal has dated the Neolithic cultures of\\nnortheastern India between 2500-1500 BCE (Agrawal 2002:201).\\nThe important sites of the region are Daojali Hading and Sarutaru in Assam, Napchik in\\nManipur and Pynthorlangtein in Meghalaya.\\n\\uf0b7 Daojali Hading\\nSituated in the North Kachhar hills of Assam, Daojali Hading revealed a 45 cm thick\\noccupation deposit. The site has yielded Neolithic stone and fossil wood axes, adzes, hoes,\\nchisels, grinding slabs, querns, mullers, handmade grey to dull red cord marked pottery as well\\nas dull red stamped pottery and plain red pottery. No domesticated cereals have been recovered\\nbut the presence of mullers and querns in the artifactual repertoire establishes the practice of\\nagricultural activity.\\n\\uf0b7 Napchik\\nNapchik, located on a hillslope in Manipur, has yielded an early thermo-luminiscent date\\nof 1650 + 350 BCE, based on an analysis of its handmade cord-marked ware. The Neolithic\\n51\\ncharacter of the site is further established by the presence of handmade tripod vessels, stone\\nchoppers, scrapers, grinding stones, polished celts etc. (Chakrabarti 2006: 261)\\n4.4.7 South India\\nThe South Indian Neolithic culture, spread over the states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh\\nand Tamil Nadu, has given us the largest number of Neolithic settlements, because of the easy\\navailability of stone. The geographical terrain of this culture is that part of the Deccan plateau\\nbound by River Bhima in the north and River Kaveri in the south, with a major concentration of\\nsites being in the Raichur and Shorapur Doabs. Besides the profusion of sites, what makes the\\nSouth Indian Neolithic remarkable is the issue of ashmounds and the location of settlements on\\nthe flat-topped or castellated granite hills or plateaux of the region. Ash mounds are vast mounds\\nof burnt cattle dung ash accumulated as a result of periodical burnings and F.R Allchin in 1960\\nsuggested a West Asian origin for these (Jain 2006:92-94).\\nHowever today, their growth and development is viewed in the context of earlier\\nindigenous Stone Age traditions.\\nSome of the important Neolithic sites of the region are: Sangankallu, Hallur,\\nTekkalakota, Brahmagiri, Maski, T.Narsipur and Piklihal in Karnataka; Utnur, Palavoy, Kodekal\\nand Budihal in Andhra Pradesh; and Paiyampalli in Tamil Nadu. The chronological bracket for\\nthese sites ranges from about 2400 to 1000 BCE.\\nThe location of Neolithic settlements near hills or plateaux seems to have been motivated\\nby access to perennial water in the form of streams or rivers, plentiful game, pasture for grazing\\nanimals and raw materials like stone and wood. Both campsites and habitation sites have been\\ndiscovered where people lived in circular wattle-and-daub huts. Hearths and storage areas have\\nbeen found in practically all the huts. Subsistence was primarily on a mixed economy –\\nrudimentary farming and animal husbandry. Charred grains of millet, barley, horse gram, black\\ngram and green gram have been found and scholars were earlier of the opinion that millet might\\nhave been introduced in south India from South Africa. But recent research negates this\\nhypothesis and favours an indigenous growth of these crops. Fish bones and charred and split\\nanimal bones show that fishing and hunting contributed substantially to dietary requirements.\\n\\uf0b7 Sangankallu\\nSangankallu presents a picture of a long occupation, beginning with the Palaeolithic\\nphase. Palaeoliths are followed by a microlithic industry of quartz flakes, cores and lunates. The\\nclassic Neolithic industry of polished stone tools features next in the sequence but not before a\\nsterile dark brown soil was formed at the site suggesting a time-gap between the Neolithic and\\nthe earlier microlithic levels (Chakrabarti 1999: 236). Coarse grey, red pottery was discovered\\nwhich was either handmade or produced on a slow wheel. Storage pits have given remains of\\ncharred grains and bones of domesticated animals like cattle, sheep and goat.\\n52\\n\\uf0b7 Piklihal\\nThe site of Piklihal is essentially an ashmound situated in District Raichur in Karnataka.\\nThe Neolithic people who occupied the site were cattle herders who had domesticated animals\\nlike cattle, sheep, goat etc. A mobile group, they set up seasonal camps surrounded by cow pens\\nmade with wooden posts and stakes in which they gathered dung. When it was time to move, the\\nentire camping ground was set afire and cleared for the next session of camping.\\n(Source: V.K. Jain, Prehistory and Protohistory of India, 2006)\\n4.5 Conclusion\\nAn overview of the expanse and variety of Neolithic cultures in the subcontinent helps us\\nto understand the larger and local dynamics, which shaped this phenomenon. While profuse\\nmicrolithic remains precede the Neolithic at some sites, others give a silent testimony and reveal\\nonly a full-blown Neolithic phase. Yet, all across the country between the fifth and first\\nmillennium BCE, people were moving towards a ‘Neolithic’ way of life – settled hutments,\\n53\\npractice of agriculture and animal husbandry, pottery and beginning of craft production. But the\\nstory of human cultural evolution did not stop here, for this was just the base on which, a large-\\nscale civilization was to arise.\\nCheck your progress exercise 2\\nA.Give names of two Neolithic sites in each of the following regions:\\n(i) North-West India (ii) North India (iii) Central India (iv) Mid-Gangetic Basin (v) Eastern India\\n(vi) North-Eastern India (vii) South India.\\nB.

Its first\\nknown cities, Harappa on the banks of a dried up bed of the Ravi river, an Indus tributary, and\\nMohenjodaro, 570 kilometres downstream, in the vicinity of the Indus river itself.\\nGeographically, however, this civilization (also called the Harappan civilization after Harappa,\\nits first known site) included much more than the Indus zone; it was a combination of riverine\\nlowlands that stretched to the east and southeast, highland areas to the north, and the coastal belt\\ntowards the southwest and southeast of the Indus system.\\n5.2 Character of the Indus civilization\\nBefore looking at its various features, it is necessary to be clear about the character of the\\nIndus civilization in order to understand what set it apart from other contemporaneous cultures in\\nthe Indian subcontinent and from the Bronze Age civilizations of West Asia and Egypt. The\\nIndus phenomenon is called a civilization because it incorporated within itself the social\\nconfigurations and organizational devices that characterize such a cultural form. It was the only\\nliterate subcontinental segment of its time. More than 4000 Indus inscriptions have been found,\\nand even though they remain undeciphered, the script was used for mercantile purposes (as\\nsuggested by the seals and sealings), personal identification (in the form of shallow inscriptions\\non bangles, bronze implements etc.) and possibly for civic purposes (underlined by the remains\\nof a massive inscribed board at Dholavira). The civilization’s essence was a settlement pattern in\\nwhich cities and towns were particularly prominent. That such urban centres contained\\nmonumental structures whose construction required large outlays of labour and resources, and\\nwere marked by heterogeneous economic activities, are other conspicuous indicators. Earlier,\\nMohenjodaro and Harappa had alone stood out as the civilization’s large cities. Today we know\\nof many more whose dimensions qualify them for a similar status. These are fairly spread out –\\nGanweriwala in Cholisatan, Dholavira in Kutch and Rakhigarhi in Haryana are such centres –\\nand symbolize the creation of aggregates of population on a scale previously unknown. The\\nlargest variety and quantity of jewellery, statuary and seals, are found in urban centres and\\nindicate that craft production was, in the main, geared to the demands of city dwellers. Further,\\nthe characters of planning, the necessity of written transactions, and the existence of a settlement\\nhierarchy in which urban and rural settlements of various sizes and types were functionally\\nconnected in important ways all indicate administrative organization on a scale that was\\nunprecedented in relation to other protohistoric subcontinental cultures. Many of these are\\narchaeological indicators of a state society as well. Whether there were several states or a unified\\nempire in Harappan times remains unclear. Urban settlements may have functioned as city-states\\nsince their layout and character suggests the presence of local aristocracies, merchants and\\ncraftspeople.\\n5.2.1 Main Features\\nThe Indus civilization, while sharing many general features with the contemporary\\nBronze Age cultures such as the Sumerian civilization of Mesopotamia and Old Kingdom Egypt,\\nhad its own distinct identity. For one thing, with a geographical spread of more than a million\\n56\\nsquare kilometers, this was the largest urban culture of its time. Unlike Mesopotamia and Egypt,\\nthere were no grand religious shrines nor were magnificent palaces and funerary complexes\\nconstructed for the rulers. Instead, its hallmark was a system of civic amenities for its citizens\\nrarely seen in other parts of the then civilized world – roomy houses with bathrooms, a network\\nof serviceable roads and lanes, an elaborate system of drainage and a unique water supply\\nsystem. Dholavira’s network of dams, water reservoirs and underground drains and\\nMohenjodaro’s cylindrical wells, one for every third house, epitomize the degree of comfort that\\ntowns people enjoyed in relation to contemporary Mesopotamians and Egyptians who had to\\nmake do with fetching water, bucket by bucket, from the nearby rivers.\\n5.3 Background and Origin\\nIndus settlements mainly, though not exclusively, flourished in the part of the Indian\\nsubcontinent, which lies west of the Delhi-Aravalli-Cambay geographical axis. Several segments\\nof that zone had seen the birth and development of agricultural communities, between 7000 BCE\\nand the genesis of urban centres in the first part of the third millennium BCE. The subsistence\\npattern that is widely seen at Harappan sites – a combination of wheat and barley cultivation and\\ndomesticated animal species in which cattle was most preferred – goes back to Mehrgarh in the\\nKachhi plain of Baluchistan which has also yielded the earliest evidence of agricultural life in\\nSouth Asia (7000 BCE). From the 5th millennium BCE onwards, this pattern is found spread all\\nover the major areas of Baluchistan, from the Zhob-Loralai region in the northeast to Las Bela\\ntowards the south.\\nAt the same time, a majority of classic Indus sites are in riverine lowlands and the\\nmanner in which settlements and subsistence patterns had evolved in those areas, over a span of\\nmore than a thousand years prior to the efflorescence of the Harappan civilization, is central to\\nunderstanding its evolution. In several lowland areas, there was a long period of antecedence. At\\nthe beginning of the fourth millennium BCE, the Cholistan tract saw a well-defined phase of\\noccupation, known as the ‘Hakra ware’ culture, named after the river around which its distinctive\\nceramic assemblage was first discovered. Although the largest concentration of sites is around\\nthe Hakra river, its spread included Jalipur in Multan and Kunal in Haryana. Most of the sites\\nseem to be small camps with a few permanently established settlements of substantial size (such\\nas Lathwala in Cholistan, with an area of 26.3 hectares). The Hakra horizon is the first culture of\\nthe lowlands, which utilized both the desert and the riverine environments, using a variety of\\nstone and copper tools. There are also occasional manufactured goods in raw materials that were\\nnot locally available, as is indicated by Jalilpur’s repertoire of semi-precious stone, coral and\\ngold beads. Towards the western fringe of the Indus lowlands, the fourth millennium BCE\\nwitnessed the birth of another culture, known as the Amri culture (after the type site of Amri)\\nwhich dominated the Kirthar piedmont and Kohistan. What is most significant is that some Amri\\nsites are marked by an ‘acro-sanctum/lower town’ division, a settlement plan that can be\\nwitnessed subsequently, in a highly developed and sophisticated form, in the layout of Indus\\ncites. The spatial exclusiveness of the ‘acro-sanctum’ is emphasized by a highly elevated,\\nconically shaped hill with encircling, terraced stone walls and remnants of ramps/stairways. The\\ngeneral habitation area, which was lower town, possibly contained domestic structures.\\n57\\nThe immediate backdrop to the Indus civilization is formed by the next phase, known as\\nthe Kot Diji culture, when elements of a common culture ethos can be seen across the Indus-\\nHakra plains and the Indo-Gangetic divide. There are several planned and fortified settlements;\\nthe construction of habitational areas aligned around a grid of north-south and east-west streets at\\nHarappa, and the use of mud bricks in the Indus ratio of 1:2:4, along with a drainage system\\nbased on soakage pits in streets at Kunal are especially noteworthy. There is also an extensive\\nbut partly standardized repertoire of ceramic designs and forms (some of which are carried over\\ninto the Indus civilization), miscellaneous crafts and a sophisticated metallurgy that includes the\\nmanufacture of silver tiaras and ‘armlets’ as also disc-shaped gold beads (typical of the Indus\\ncivilization), wide transport and exchange of raw materials, square stamp seals with designs, the\\npresence of at least two signs of Indus writing at Padri and Dholavira (both in Gujarat) and ritual\\nbeliefs embodied in a range of terracotta cattle and female figurines. Considered in totality, the\\nterm ‘early Harappan’ is appropriate for this phase since a number of features related to the\\nmature Harappan period (a designation used for the classic urban, civilizational form) are already\\npresent. Several of these features also evoke the presence of commercial and other elite social\\ngroups. When one considers the intensification of craft specialization, dependent on extensive\\nnetworks through which the required raw materials were procured, or the necessity of irrigation\\nfor agriculture in the Indus flood plain, without the risk of crop failure, for which a degree of\\nplanning and management was essential, the emergence and the character of the controlling or\\nruling elites becomes clear.\\nOn the whole, there is little doubt that the Indus civilization had indigenous roots and that\\nits cultural precursors were the Chalcolithic cultures of the northwest that flourished in the fourth\\nand third millennia BCE. Contrary to the views of some early scholars, Indus cities were not\\ncreated either through the dissemination of the ‘idea’ of civilization or by migration of\\npopulation groups from West Asia.\\n5.4 Chronology\\nIt is unlikely that civilizational efflorescence was a simultaneous process in all parts of\\nthe Harappan distribution area. By 2600 BCE, this civilization was in existence, as it had clear\\ncontacts, at that point of time, with Mesopotamia. It appears increasingly probable that it\\nmatured first in lower Sind, Cholistan and presumably, the Kutch region, which was linked by a\\nriver to the Cholistan area. Cities like Harappa, Kalibangan and Banawali came up a little later.\\nThe end was also staggered in time. Urban decline at Mohenjodaro had set by 2200 BCE and by\\n2100 BCE it had ceased to exist as a city. However, the civilization continued after 2000 BCE in\\nother areas and at some sites survived till 1800 BCE.\\n5.5 Geographical Distribution\\nIndus settlements (over 1000 in number) are spread over a wide swathe or strip of\\nnorthwest India and Pakistan and their distribution illuminates the various ways in which this\\nvaried geographical areas was exploited. In the lower Indus basin of Larkana, Mohenjodaro\\ndominated the flood plain, agriculturally the richest part of Sind. Larkana is also marked by lake\\ndepressions, such as the Manchhar, where fishing settlements existed. Towards the west, there\\nwere clusters of sites in the foothills of the Kirthar mountain range and the Kohistan. There,\\n58\\nagriculture must have depended on spring water and rains. Routes linking up with Baluchistan\\nalso passed through this area. In upper Sind, the Sukkur-Rorhi hills saw settlements of workmen\\nin and around flint quarries, the raw material from which Harappan blades were manufactured.\\nThe course of the Indus river in the third millennium BCE was more southeasterly and it flowed\\ninto the Arabian sea in the vicinity of the Rann of Kutch. The Indus river adopted its present\\ncourse only between the tenth and the thirteenth centuries AD.\\nAs one moves west, Baluchistan is reached where Harappan settlements are found in a\\nvariety of terrain – across the northern, mountain rim, on the flat Kacchi plain, in the district of\\nLas Bela towards the south and along the coastal country known as the Makran. In the latter area,\\nthe fortified sites of Sutkagendor and Sotka-koh were important in terms of the Indus\\ncivilization’s sea trade with the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia. Both were suitable landing\\nplaces for maritime traffic and from these points, convenient routes linked up with the interior. In\\nother parts of Baluchistan, Indus sites are found in areas that are still agriculturally viable and lie\\non arterial routes. Pathani Damb, for instance, was near the Mula pass, from where a route went\\nacross the Kirthar range while Naushahro was in the general vicinity of the Bolan, through which\\na major route led to Afghanistan. Such routes were important because through them,\\nBaluchistan’s metalliferrous ores (copper and lead) and semi-precious stone (lapis lazuli and\\nturquoise) could be procured by the resource-poor Indus valley. The northernmost site of the\\nIndus civilization, Shortughai, is in northeast Afghanistan. Shortughai provided access to\\nBadakshan’s lapis lazuli and possibly to the tin and gold resources of Central Asia.\\nTo the northeast of Sind is the Pakistan province of Punjab. A large part of the province\\nis comprised of doabs or tracts lying between two rivers. Of these, the Bari doab (or land\\nbetween the Ravi and an old bed of the Beas) sites are noteworthy, especially the sprawling city\\nof Harappa. There are no settlements in the interfluves of the Jhelum and the Indus or that of the\\nJhelum and Chenab. South of the Sutlej river, is Bahawalpur. Part of it is made up of the desert\\ntrace of Cholistan, through which the Hakra river flowed. The largest cluster (174) of Indus\\nsettlements is found here. Geographically, this tract connects the Indus plains with Rajasthan,\\nwhich has vast copper deposits. There were several exclusive, industrial sites (79 of them) in\\nCholistan, marked by kilns, devoted to large-scale craft production that included the melting and\\nsmelting of copper.\\nEast of the Sutlej is the alluvial terrain of the Indo-Gangetic divide, a transitional area\\nbetween the Indus and the Ganga river systems, made up of the Indian states of Punjab, Haryana,\\nDelhi and Ghaggar river course in Rajasthan. A large part of the riverine and stream drainage\\nfrom the Siwalik ridge between the Sutlej and Yamuna used to converge into the Ghaggar, the\\nIndian name for the river known as the Hakra in Pakistan. There were several provincial urban\\ncentres in this region such as Kalibangan and Banawali although Rakhigarhi (in the Hissar\\ndistrict of Haryana) was the largest city and is said to be as large as Harappa. Classic Indus sites\\nare also found in the Yamuna-Ganga doab, with preponderance in its most northerly portion\\naround Saharanpur.\\nFinally, the spread of the Indus civilization included the quadrilateral of roughly 119,000\\nsquare kilometers between the Rann of Kutch and the Gulf of Cambay. Dholavira was the city\\npar excellence of the Rann, with its vast expanse of tidal mud flats and dead creeks. Further east,\\n59\\nthe great mass of Kathiawad, now known as Saurashtra, is formed of Deccan lava and on its\\neastern edge flourished the port town of Lothal. The mainland of Gujarat is alluvial, formed by\\nthe Sabarmati, Mahi and minor parallel streams, actively prograding into the Gulf of Cambay.\\nHere, Bhagatrav, on the estuary of the Kim river, forms the southernmost extension of the Indus\\ncivilization.\\nCheck your progress exercise 1\\nA.

Name two sites where Harappan settlements have been found in each of the following\\nareas:\\n(i) Sind (ii)Baluchistan (iii) Gujarat (iv) Haryana.\\n5.6 Settlement pattern\\nThe settlement pattern was a multi-tiered one with urban and rural sites that were\\nmarkedly varied in terms of size and function. There were cities of monumental dimensions like\\nMohenjodaro, Harappa, Dholavira and Rakhigarhi that stand out on account of their size (more\\nthan 100 hectares each) and the character of their excavated remains. While the older premise\\nthat such cities were based on a gridiron system of planning has been shown by recent research\\nto be invalid, there is impressive evidence of centralized planning. City space was divided into\\npublic and residential sectors. At Harappa and Mohenjodaro, the separation of the largely\\n(though not exclusively) public administrative sector from the residential part of the city took the\\nform of two separate mounds. Dholavira’s city plan was more intricate. At its fully developed\\nstage, it had three parts made up of the citadel which was divided into a ‘castle’ and a ‘bailey’\\narea, the idle town and the lower town, all interlinked and within an elaborate system of\\nfortification.\\nThe character of some of the structure is also worth considering. Mohenjodaro’s citadel,\\nfor instance, was constructed on a gigantic artificial platform (400 x 100m) made of a mud brick\\nretaining wall (over 6m thick) enclosing a filling of sand and silt. This platform, after being\\nenlarged twice, attained a final height of 7 metres and provided a foundation on which further\\nplatforms were built in order to elevate important structures such as the Great Bath and the\\ngranary, so that the highest buildings were about 20 metres above the surrounding plains and\\ncould be seen on the horizons for miles around. Another architectural marvel is Dholavira’s\\n60\\nsystem of water management, crucial in an area, which is prone to frequent droughts. Rain water\\nin the catchment areas of the two seasonal streams – Manhar and Mansar – was dammed and\\ndiverted to the large reservoirs within the city walls. Apparently, there were 16 water reservoirs\\nwithin the city walls, covering as much as 36 percent of the walled area. Brick masonry walls\\nprotected them, although reservoirs were also made by cutting into the bedrock. Furthermore,\\ndrains in the ‘castle-bailey’ area carried rainwater to a receptacle for later use.\\nThe intermediate tier of the urban hierarchy was made up of sites that in several features\\nrecall the layout of the monumental cities of the civilization but are smaller in size. Kalibangan,\\nLothal, Kot Diji, Banawali and Amri are some of them and they can be considered as provincial\\ncentres. Kalibangan, like Mohenjodaro and Harappa, comprised of two fortified mounds – the\\nsmaller western one contained several mud brick platforms with fire altars on one of them. Most\\nof the houses on the eastern mound had fire-altars of a similar type. Lothal was also a fortified\\ntown with its entire eastern sector being taken up by a dockyard (219x13m in size) which was\\nconnected with the river through an inlet channel. In its vicinity was the ‘acropolis’ where the\\nremains of a storehouse, in which clay sealings, some with impressions of cords and other\\nmaterials on them, were discovered. Lothal’s urban morphology also suggests that there is no\\nnecessary relationship between the size of a city and its overall planning. Mohenjodaro was at\\nleast 25 times the size of Lothal but the latter shares with it the presence of two separate areas,\\nburnt brick houses, and regularly aligned streets and drains. In fact, it paved streets and lanes are\\nunrivalled in the Indus context. The third tier of the Indus settlement hierarchy is made up of\\nsmall, urban sites. These show some evidence of planning but no internal sub-divisions.\\nNotwithstanding their size and structurally unprepossessing character, they had urban functions.\\nAllahadino in Sind is one such site, which had a diameter of only 100 metres but was an\\nimportant metal crafting centre. Similarly, Kuntasi in Gujarat is a small Harappan fortified\\nsettlement where semi-precious stones and copper were processed.\\nFinally, urban centres were supported by and functionally connected with rural\\nhinterlands of sedentary villages and temporary / semi-nomadic settlements. While the latter are\\ngenerally small with thin occupational deposits, in the case of villages, outlines of huts and\\nrelatively thick deposits have been encountered. Kanewal in Gujarat, for instance, is 300 square\\nmetres and its cultural deposit (of 1.5 metre thickness) is suggestive of a secure village\\nsettlement. Similarly, the archaeological deposits of the Harappan phase in the Yamuna-Ganga\\ndoab – 1.8 metres at Alamgirpur and 1.4 metres at Hulas – indicates that the pioneer colonizers\\nof that area lived there for a long period of time. What is worth remembering is that, on the basis\\nof size, it is not wise to distinguish rural and urban sites of the Indus civilization. In Cholistan,\\nthere are a few large sites, one of which covers 25 hectares (and, thus, is larger than Kalibangan),\\nwhich have been described as nomadic settlements, not urban ones. On the other hand, Kuntasi\\nwas only 2 hectares in size but has been rightly classified as an urban settlement because of its\\nfunctional role as a provider of craft objects.\\n5.7 Subsistence Pattern\\nA stable system of agriculture, supplemented by animal husbandry, hunting and plant\\ngathering, provided economic sustenance to urban networks. In view of the widely differing\\necological conditions of the distribution area of this civilization, the subsistence strategy is not\\n61\\nlikely to have been a single or uniform one. The Harappans were familiar with the plough.\\nTerracotta ploughs have been found at Indus sites in Cholistan and at Banawali and a ploughed\\nfield was revealed through excavation at Kalibangan. Though it belonged to the early Harappan\\nperiod, there is no reason to doubt that the pattern continued during the mature Harappan period.\\nThe Kalibangan field contained two sets of furrows crossing each other at right angles, thus\\nforming a grid pattern, and it is likely that two crops were raised in the same field. In modern\\nfields in that zone, mustard is grown in one set of furrows and horse gram in the other. Mixed\\ncropping is suggested by other evidence as well as, for instance, in the mixture of wheat and\\nbarley at Indus sites. Such missed cropping is practiced even today in many parts of north India\\nas an insurance against weather hazards so that wheat fails to ripen, the hardier barley is sure to\\nyield a crop.\\nEarlier, a broad division of cultivated crops among those areas in and around the Indus\\nvalley on the one hand and Gujarat on the other hand, used to be recognized. In the Indus area,\\nthe cereal component was considered to be exclusively of wheat and barley while in Gujarat, rice\\nand millets were more important. However, both rice and finger millet have now been discovered\\nin Harappa. There is a range of other cultivated crops including peas, lentils, chickpeas, sesame,\\nflax, legumes and cotton. The range suggests cotton. In Sind, cotton is usually a summer crop\\nand such crops have generally been cultivated with the help of irrigation. This is because rainfall\\nis extremely scanty, at about 8 inches. In any part of the Indian subcontinent which has less than\\n10 or 12 inches of rainfall, if agriculture on any scale has to be carried out with a substantial\\nreduction of the risk factor, it can only be done with irrigation.\\nCattle meat was the favourite animal food of the Indus people and cattle bones have been\\nfound in large quantities at all sites that have yielded bones. In addition to their meat, cattle and\\nbuffaloes must have supported agricultural operations and served as draught animals. Among\\nother things, this is suggested by their age of slaughter. At Shikarpur in Gujarat, a majority of the\\ncattle and buffaloes lived up to the age of maturity (approximately three years) and were then\\nkilled at various stages till they reached eight years of age. Mutton was also popular and bones of\\nsheep/goat have been found at almost all Indus sites. Hunting of animals was not a negligible\\nactivity; the ratio of the bones of wild animals in relation to domesticated varieties is 1:4. The\\nanimals include wild buffalo, various species of deer, wild pig, ass, jackal, rodents and hare. The\\nremains of fish and marine molluscs are frequently found as well. As for food gathering, wild\\nrice was certainly consumed in the Yamuna-Ganga doab although the most striking evidence\\ncomes from Surkotada in Gujarat where the overwhelming majority of identified seeds are of\\nwild nuts, grasses and weeds. In general, the Indus food economy was a broad-based, risk-\\nmitigating system – a pragmatic strategy, considering the large and concentrated population\\ngroups that had to be supported.\\n5.8 Artisanal Production and Trade\\n5.8.1 Artisanal Production\\nA spectacular range of artisanal production is encountered at Indus cities. On the one\\nhand, specialized crafts that had roots in the preceding period became more complex in terms of\\ntechnological processes, and on the other hand, the combinations of raw materials being used,\\n62\\nexpanded. Along with the widespread urban demand for shell artifacts, semi-precious stone and\\nsteatite beads, faience objects, and implements as also jewellery in base and precious metals. It is\\nnow reasonably clear that the Indus civilization was not, in the main, a bronze using culture. Pure\\ncopper was the dominant tradition. Additionally, there was a variety of alloys ranging from low\\nand high grade bronzes to copper-lead and copper-nickel alloys.\\nSome of the crafted objects are quintessentially Indus, in the sense that they are neither\\nfound prior to the advent of the urban civilization nor after its collapse. Indus seals (inscribed,\\nsquare or rectangular in shape, with representations of animals, most notably the ‘unicorn’) for\\nexample, are rarely found in the late Harappan and post-Harappan contexts since the commercial\\ntransactions for which they were used had dramatically shrunk. This is also true for the series of\\nIndus stone statues of animals and men, of which the most famous is that of the ‘Priest King’.\\nThese appear to have had a politico-religious significance and are in a sculptural idiom that is\\nvery much within the realm of ‘High Art’. The disappearance of this stone carving tradition can\\nbe linked to the abandonment of urban centres, along with the migration and transformation of\\nelite groups. Similarly, long barrel carnelian beads are a typical Indus luxury product, which\\nwere primarily manufactured at Chanhundaro. Their crafting demanded both skill and time; the\\nperforation in a 6 to13 cm length bead required between three to eight days. Evidently, the\\nlargely deurbanized scenario that followed the collapse of cities could not sustain such a\\nspecialized production.\\nOne of the most striking features of the Indus craft traditions is that they are not region-\\nspecific. Shell objects were manufactured at Nagwada and Nageshwar in Gujarat and at\\nChanhundaro and Mohenjodaro in Sind. Similarly, metal artefacts were produced at Lothal in\\nGujarat, at Harappa in the Bari doab of Punjab and at Allahadino and Mohenjodaro in Sind.\\nWhile craft objects were manufactured at many places, the manufacturing technology could be\\nsurprisingly standardized. In the case of shell bangles, at practically all sites they had a uniform\\nwidth of between 5 mm and 7 mm and they were almost everywhere sawn by a saw that had a\\nblade thickness of between 0.4 mm and 0.6mm. What is equally striking about the wide\\ndistribution of craft production is that, in a number of cases, manufacture depended on raw\\nmaterials that were not locally available. At Mohenjodaro, shell artifacts were manufactured\\nfrom the marine mollusc, Turbinella pyrum, found along the Sind and Baluchistan coast which\\nwas brought in a raw state from there. Similarly, there is impressive evidence of manufacture of\\ncopper based craft items at Harappa ranging from furnaces to slag and unfinished objects, even\\nthough the city was located in a minerally poor area.\\n5.8.2 Trade\\nThe above mentioned craft production could survive and prosper because of a highly\\norganized trading system. Indus people had the capacity to mobilize resources from various areas\\nranging from Rajasthan to Afghanistan and, considering the scale of manufacture, it is likely that\\nthere were full-time traders that helped in providing the necessary raw materials. Most of these\\nresource-rich areas also show evidence of contact with the Indus civilization. For example, at\\nChalcolithic Kulli culture sites, Harappan unicorn seals and pottery have been found. Similarly,\\nthe exploitation of Rajasthan’s raw materials is underlined by Harappan pottery at some sites of\\n63\\nthe Ganeshwar-Jodhpura chacolithic complex and by the strong stylistic similarities in the copper\\narrowheads, spearheads and fish hooks of the two cultures.\\nIn addition to raw materials, other types of objects were traded. On the one hand, there\\nwas trade in food items as is underlined by the presence of marine cat fish at Harappa, a city that\\nwas hundreds of kilometers away from the sea. Craft items were also traded. Small\\nmanufacturing centres like Nageshwar were providing shell ladles to Mohenjodaro which also\\nreceived chert blades from the Rorhi hills of Sind. It is now possible to visualize the exchange of\\nfinished objects between the monumental cities of the Indus civilization as well. For instance,\\nstoneware bangles – a highly siliceous, partially sintered ceramic body with low porosity –\\nmanufactured at Mohenjodaro have been found 570 kilometres north, at Harappa. The nature of\\nthe social process involved in this exchange is unknown but is unlikely to be a case of satisfying\\nan economic demand, since Harappa was also producing such bangles. Possibly, the\\nunidirectional movement of some bangles from Mohenjodaro to Harappa is related to social\\ntransactions among related status or kin groups in the two cities.\\nThe Indus civilization had wide ranging contacts with cultures and civilizations to the\\nnorthwest and west of its distribution area. Indus and Indus-related objects have been found in\\nnorth Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, north and south Iran, Bahrain, Failaka and the Oman Peninsula\\nin the Persian Gulf, and north and south Mesopotamia. The objects include etched carnelian and\\nlong barrel-cylinder carnelian beads, square/ rectangular Indus seals, pottery with the Indus\\nscript, ‘Indus’ motifs on local seals, ivory objects, and various terracottas such as ithyphallic\\nspecimens that have strong Indus analogues. Externally derived objects and traits have been\\nfound at Indus sites such as seals with Mesopotamian and Persian Gulf affinities, externally\\nderived motifs on seals and steatite/ chlorite vessels.\\nAt the same time, the importance that has been attached in Indus studies to the regions\\nwest of Baluchistan as the main areas from which the Indus civilization procured its raw\\nmaterials, whether it is copper from Oman or carnelian of Persian Gulf origin is somewhat\\nmisplaced. There is an abundance of raw materials on the peripheries and within the area where\\nIndus cities and settlements flourished. Before the advent of Indus urbanism, these raw materials\\nwere being used by the various cultures that were antecedent to the Indus civilization and\\nsubsequently as well, they continued to be a part of the repertories of late/post-Harappan\\nhorizons, albeit on a reduced scale as compared to the situation during the civilizational phase.\\nWhile, there may have been some raw materials involved in long distance trade, there is no\\nreason to argue that the Indus civilization was in any way either solely or significantly dependent\\non the regions to the west for such resources.\\nCheck your progress exercise 2\\nA. State True or False:\\n(i) The settlement pattern of the Harappan Civilization was a multi-tiered one with urban\\nand rural sites that were markedly varied in terms of size and function.\\n(ii) One of the most striking features of the Indus craft traditions is that they are region-\\nspecific.\\n64\\n(iii) The Harappans were familiar with the plough.\\n(iv) The Indus civilization had wide ranging contacts with cultures and civilizations to the\\nnorthwest and west of its distribution area.\\n(v) The Indus Civilization was solely dependent on the regions to the west for the raw\\nmaterials.\\n5.9 Religious Beliefs\\nOne of the most complex issues concerning ancient history is to determine past ways of\\nthought and beliefs, especially in the case of the Indus civilization where these must be inferred\\nfrom material remains, since its writing has not been satisfactorily deciphered. The\\narchaeological indicators here are mainly portable objects of various kinds, figural\\nrepresentations and a few areas within settlements which seem to have been set apart for sacred\\npurposes. There are no structures at Indus sites that can be described as temples nor are there any\\nstatues, which can be considered as images that were worshiped. A few structures reflect a\\nconnection between concepts of cleansing through water relation to ritual functions. The sunken,\\nrectangular basin known as the ‘Great Bath’ at Mohenjodaro is one such instance. The cult\\nconnection of this water using structure is evident from its method of construction which had\\nthree concentric zones around it, including streets on all four sides (making it the only free\\nstanding structure of the city), for the purpose of a ritual procession leading into it. The bathing\\npavements and well in the vicinity of the offering pits on Kalibangan’s citable also underline this\\nconnection. As for beliefs connected with fertility, it is possible that some terracotta figurines\\nfound at Mohanjodaro and Harappa represent such beliefs. At towns like Kalibangan and\\nSurkotada, female figurines are practically absent. Even at Mohenjodaro, the fact that only 475\\nof the total number of terracotta figurines and fragments represented the female form means that\\nthis was not as common a practice as it has been made out to be. Several of the female figurines\\nwere utilized as lamps or for the burning of incense. Fertility in relation to the male principle has\\nalso been evoked not merely in the context on the ‘Siva-Pasupati’ seal but also with reference to\\nthe phallic stones that have been found at Mohenjodaro, Harappa and Dholavira as also with\\nregard to a miniature terracotta representation of a phallic emblem set in a ovular shaped flat\\nreceptacle from Kalibangan. Religious sancity was associated with particular trees and animals\\nas well. The presence of partly human-partly animal characters on Indus seals and a human\\npersonage on a pipal (ficus religiosia) tree, in fact, suggest a shamanistic component in Harappan\\nreligion. None of these features, however suggest a transregional Indus religion with cult centres\\nand state dominated rituals, of the kind that is writ large on the architectural landscape of Bronze\\nAge West Asia and Egypt.\\n5.10 Decline and Devolution\\nThe process of urban decline appears to have unfolded in various ways. At Mohenjodaro\\nthere was a steady deterioration, apparent in the fact that the walls of the terminal level structures\\nare frequently thin walled, haphazardly laid out, made of unstandardized bricks. This is also true\\nof Dholavira whose progressive impoverishment was hastened by two spells when the city was\\ndeserted. As urbanism crumbled, rickety, jerry-built structures and the reused stones robbed from\\nolder structures came to be commonly encountered on the other hand, Kalibangan was\\nabandoned relatively suddenly and the same is true for Banawali. In other words, it is not one\\n65\\nevent but different kinds of events that must have led to the disappearance of urban life. There is,\\nhowever, no unanimity about these events or about their relative importance. In fact, the collapse\\nof the Indus civilization continues to be a focus of large historical speculation and debate.\\nThe earliest formulations for urban collapse revolved around the hypothetical Aryans and\\nthe allusions in the Rigveda to the destruction wreaked on forts/cities by them. This idea\\ncontinued to remain a popular one till the 1940s when archaeological ‘proof’ of Aryan invasions\\nwas claimed to have been discovered at Mohenjodaro, on the one hand, in the assortment of\\nscattered skeletons (apparently signs of a ‘massacre’) and at Harappa, on the other hand, in the\\nform of deliberate blocking of entrances and a culture (Cemetery H) overlying the mature\\nHarappan phase which was supposed to represent the conquerors. Since the 1950s, however\\nserious doubts have been raised about the historicity of an Aryan invasion. Among other things,\\nit has been demonstrated that the massacre evidence was based on very few skeletons that cannot\\nbe dated to the same stratum.\\nIncreasingly, greater attention has been paid to the question of the environment in the\\nIndus distribution area and the role of rivers and climate in the decline of an urban culture. At\\nseveral Indus cities such as Mohenjodaro, Chanhudaro and Lothal, there are silt debris\\nintervening between phases of occupation and these underline the possibility of damage being\\ncaused by the inundations of swollen rivers. It has been suggested that the excess river water was\\na product of earthquakes. The river in question is the Ghaggar-Hakra, often been identified with\\nthe Vedic Sarasvati, which was drying up number of sites dramatically shrank in the phase that\\npost-dates the urban one. The reduction in the flow of the Ghaggar-Hakra was a consequence of\\nriver diversion and, according to one group of scholars it was the Sutlej that abandoned its\\nchannel and began to flow westwards, while others have contended that the Yamuna was\\ndiverted from the Indus into the Ganges system.\\nThe impact of the Harappans on their environment is also a factor that has been\\nconsidered as contributing to the collapse of the Indus civilization. A possible disequilibrium\\nbetween urban demand and the carrying capacity of the land, leading to a fodder requirements\\nand fuel for firing bricks are among the explanations that have been offered. However, the\\narchaeological scaffolding for supporting such arguments remains to be systematically worked\\nout. In the stretch that lies roughly east of Cholistan, the absence of long-term cultural roots has\\nbeen highlighted. It has been suggested that since the Indus phenomenon there did not evolve\\nthrough a long process but was imposed on a hunting-gathering economic context, its presence\\nover time came to be thinly stretched and eventually, could not be sustained. The question of the\\nabsence of a long antecedence for the civilization in the Indo-Gangetic divide and Gujarat may\\nrequire modification in the context of the discovery of cultures antedating the mature Harappan\\nphase in Kutch and Saurashtra on the one hand, and in the Hissar area of Haryana on the other.\\nAt the same time, in the period following the demise of the urban form, chalcolithic village\\ncultures as also microlithic hunter-gatherers are encountered, an indicator that such cultures were\\neconomically sustainable in those regions. However, the highly complex system of an urban\\ncivilization, which delicately balanced different social and economic sub-system, was no longer\\nviable.\\n66\\nWhat followed the collapse of Indus urbanism was a variety of late/post Harappan\\ncultures – the Cemetery H culture in Punjab and Cholistan, the Jhukar culture of Sind, the\\nRangpur IIB and Lustrous Red Ware phases of Gujarat. In this latter phase, a few elements of the\\nHarappan tradition, by which one means features whose genealogy can be located in the mature\\nharappan period, persisted to a greater or lesser degree, medicated by other cultural elements.\\nHowever, the civilization had ended and even though aspects of this traditioncontinued, it was in\\na landscape whose cultural diversity contrasts sharply with that of the preceding, mature\\nHarappan period.\\n5.11 Conclusion\\nWhat does the end of the Indus civilization mean in relation to the character of the\\ncultural developments that followed? Urban settlements, for example, did not disappear\\ncompletely – Kudwala in Cholistan, Beyt Dwaraka off the coast of Gujarat and Daimabad in the\\nupper Godavari basin are three of them. But they are relatively few, and certainly there is not a\\ncity that matches the grandeur and monumentality of Mohenjodaro and Harappan cities, these are\\nnow few and far between, although baked bricks and drains are present in the Cemetery H\\noccupation at Harappa while at Sanghol there was a solid mud platform on which mud houses\\nstood. Writing is occasionally encountered but remains generally confined to a few postsherds.\\nThe same holds true for seals, which became rare, and at Daimabad and Jhukar are circular, not\\nrectangular like the typical Indus specimens. The Dholavira specimens, on the other hand, are\\nrectangular but without figures. The other indicator of a reduction in the scale of trade is the\\nrelatively sparse evidence of interregional procurement of raw materials. On the whole, one\\nwould say that elements emblematic of the urban tradition of the Indus civilization dramatically\\nshrank and finally disappeared.\\nNot everything that is associated with the Indus civilization disappeared, as it were,\\nwithout a trace. A few craft traditions survived urban collapse and are found in the makeup of the\\nlate/post-Harappan mosaic. Faience was one such craft and ornaments fashioned out of this\\nsynthetic stone are commonly found in the post-Harappan period. A similar continuity can be\\nseen in the character of metal technology, although there was a general decrease in the use of\\ncopper. The bronzes from Daimabad in Maharashtra made by the “lost wax” process and the\\nreplication of a marine shell in copper at Rojdi in Gujarat are evidence of this and underline the\\ncontinuation of the technical excellence of the Indus copper and copper alloy traditions. There\\nwas diversification of agriculture. In settlements of late/post-Harappan lineage in the aftermath\\nof the Indus phenomenon there was no cultural cohesion or artefactual uniformity of the kind\\nthat was a hallmark of that civilization. Instead of a civilization, there were cultures, each with its\\nown distinct regional identity.\\nCheck your progress exercise 3\\nA.

The differences between these\\ncultures were not fundamental but were primarily confined to pottery. These cultures which are\\nmarked by the use of a limited amount of copper and an abundance of lithic blades, are said to\\nhave their first appearance at the turn of the second millennium BCE.\\n70\\n6.2 The Ochre Colour Pottery (OCP) Culture\\nThe OCP culture can be seen as a late contemporary of the mature Harappa and late\\nHarappan cultures, with certain sites showing contact between them.Most ochre-coloured pottery\\nsites are found in the Gangetic doab which is an alluvial plain. Two broad categories of the OCP\\nhave been suggested: Zone A, (Western) type and Zone B (Eastern) type. The Zone A OCP\\nwhich is said to be evidently influenced by the Harappan, has been reported from Jodhpura,\\nSiswal, Mitathal, Bara, Ambkheri and Bargaon. The main shapes are bowls, dishes, vases,\\nknobbed lids, dish-on-stand and vases with flared rimes. The Zone B OCP, marked by the\\nabsence of the basin with beaded rim, the dish-on stand and the flask has been reported from Lal\\nQila, Atranjikhera and Saipali.\\nAt several places in the upper Gangetic basin (Nasirpur, Jhinjhana, Bahadarabad etc.)\\nCopper Hoards were discovered and at all these sites the OCP was also found thereby suggesting\\nan association between the two. But according to D.P. Aggarwal such association needs further\\nconfirmation and should be, for the time being, treated as provisional.\\n6.3 The Copper hoard Culture\\nA number of Copper Hoards comprising rings, flat and shouldered celts, harpoons,\\nantennae swords, axes, anthropomorphic figures, double-edged axes, socketed axes, etc. have\\nbeen found in a wide area ranging from the Chotanagpur plateau to the upper Gangetic basin. As\\nmost of the discoveries were chance finds, no other associated artifacts were reported. Bhagrapir,\\nBahadarabad, Sanauli. Fatehgarh, Niori, Nasirpur, Bisauli and Midnapore are some of the\\nimportant sites at which the Copper Hoards have been reported. No C-14 dates are available for\\nthe Copper Hoard culture.\\n(Source: V.K. Jain, Prehistory and Protohistory of India, 2006)\\n71\\nCheck your progress exercise 1\\nA.

Name two representative sites for each of the following cultures.\\n(i) The Ochre Colour Pottery (OCP) Culture\\n(ii) The Copper hoard Culture\\n6.4 The Chalcolithic Cultures of Western, Central and Eastern India\\nThe Chalcolithic cultures are identified on the basis of their geographical location. We\\nshall briefly discuss some of these cultures which were basically village settlements and were\\nnamed after their type sites. These cultures shared certain common features such as painted\\npottery, which is mostly black-on-red, and a highly specialized stone blade/flake industry.\\n6.4.1 The Ahar or the Banas Culture\\nAhar and Gilund are the main sites which have been properly excavated, though more\\nthan fifty sites of the culture are known in the valley of Rivers Banas and Berach in South-east\\nRajasthan.\\nBoth Ahar and Gilund are fairly large settlements. The mound at Ahar measures 500 X\\n270 X 13m and has several building phases. Excavations have revealed that the plinth of the\\nhouses at Ahar was built with roughly dressed slabs of schist. The walls were made with mud or\\nmud-bricks. Timber was used, but sparingly, for the central upright pillars, and probably for the\\nlong, horizontal beams, which supported the roof. The roof was sloping and thatched with\\nbamboos, and additionally covered with grass and leaves, but not tiles. Houses were of both kind\\nlarge and small. The floors of the houses were made either of burnt clay or clay mixed with the\\nriver gravel.\\nBigger houses had partitioned walls and chulahs (hearths) were an invariable feature of\\nthe kitchen. Some of the chulahs are quite big suggesting that some houses had large families\\nand two or three dishes were cooked together in equally large vessels. More frequent than\\nchulahs were saddle querries and clay baking pans. These clearly indicate that the grinding and\\nbaking of bread were practiced by the people.\\nJawari (a type of millet) is known from the potery matrix of Period II. There are also\\nimpressions of long grained rice. No other grains, either charred or otherwise, have been found.\\nAnimal bones, however, are in plenty; turtle, fish, goat; sheep, deer, pig and cattle were eaten.\\nBovines dominate the animal remains.\\n72\\nOut of the seven main wares associated with the Banas culture, the black-and-red ware,\\npainted in white on the exterior, is the characteristic pottery. The common shapes are bowls and\\ndishes and the pottery is wheelmade. Bowls, lotas and ribbed vessels constitute the main shapes\\nin the Red slipped ware. This pottery is also wheelmade and the colours of the slip range from\\ntan, orange to chocolate.\\nThe terracotta art was well developed. Another important aspect of the Ahar culture is\\nthat while at Ahar stone axes or blades are completely absent, in Gilund and Kayatha, we find a\\ndeveloped blade industry. At Ahar only copper was used and five axes, one knife blade, one\\nsheet, a bangle and two rings of copper have been found.\\nThe available C-14 dates suggest a 2000-1400 BCE bracket for the Banas culture.\\n6.4.2 The Kayatha Culture\\nAmong the Chalcolithic culture in central India, the earliest seems to be the Kayatha\\nculture which is bracketed between circa 2000 and 1800 BCE, as indicated by the C-14 dates.\\nKayatha is the only site which has been properly excavated, although forty others sites\\nrepresenting this culture are known.\\nKayatha culture has been divided into mainly three period-Period I is marked by 3\\ndistinct pottery types, a number of copper axes and microliths including blades and points, and\\nbeads of crystal, agate, carnelian and steatite. Period II is characterized by Ahar type Black-and\\nRed ware Period III represents a culture, typified not merely at Kayatha but also at Navdatoli,\\nNagda, Eran, Tripuri, Besnagar and Avra. This phase is better known as Malwa Chalcolithic.\\nThe Kayatha culture is characterized by three distinct ceramic industries, a thick, sturdy\\nBrown slipped ware paintedin violet or deep red being the most predominant. The designs are\\ngenerally linear, painted on the rim. Main shapes of this ware are bowls, basins and globular jar\\nwith concave necks. Some storage jars have also been found.\\nAnother important ceramaic is the Buff Painted Red Ware. It is thin walled and of\\nextremely fine fabric. The pots of this ware have a buff surface because of the wash of that\\ncolour over which geometric design— like loops festoons, latticed diamonds, oblique lines— are\\nexpected in red pigment. Concave necked jars, basins and lotas are the main shapes, the last one\\ndeserving special attention. It is a small vessel with a carinated body, bulbous bottom and a\\nflaring rim. M.K. Dhavalikar traces the origin of the Malwa ware from the Buff Painted red ware\\nof Kayatha since the shape and even the fabric are common between the two cultures.\\nThe third main ware is the Combed Ware. It is a pottery of fine fabric, usually without a\\nslip or a wash of any kind. It is decorated with incised patterns such as chevrons, Zigzags, etc.\\nThese incised decorations seem to have been executed with a comb-like instrument.\\nNo complete house plan is available. The post-holes indicate the use of circular and\\nrectangular huts made of perhaps slit bamboo screens. No burials have been reported.\\n73\\nThe Kayathans, it seems, had mastered the copper technology as is apparaent from the\\nfind of two copper axes. These have a sharp cutting edge and alenticular section; the other edge\\nhas been hammered and thickened obviously for making it convient for hafting. The axes are cast\\nin a mould unlike the later chalcolithic specimens which were just hammered to shape in central\\nIndia and Deccan. A chisel is also reported from here.\\nAssociated with the copper tools was a specialized blade flake industry comprising\\nparallel-sided blades, pen knife blades, points, lunates with blunted black etc. The stone used is\\nmostly chalcedony which was available in the form of veins in the nearby rocks.\\nOther objects of common occurrence are beads, bangles, wristlets and anklets: vessels,\\ndaggers, spears and swords are rare. Two necklaces of long barel, short bicone, and oblate beads\\nof carnelian and agate were found in a pot. Each necklace was made of 160-170 beads. Another\\nnecklace of 40,000 microbeads of steatite was also discovered from a pot.\\nA similar discovery of copper bangles and semi-precious bead neclaces from pots had\\nalso been made at Mohenjodaro. This further supports the claim of a Harappan affinity. The\\nbasis for similarities with the Sothi or the pre-Harappan culture, however, seems to be firmer.\\nThe Combed ware and the Red Slipped ware of Sothi and Kayatha have quite specific affinities.\\nSankalia has therefore surmised that when the Harappan pushed out the pre-Harappans from\\nRajasthan, they colonized Malwa. This eastward migration might explain the term ‘Kalisindh’\\nand the presence of a pottery which has some resemblance to the pre-Harappan or Indus pottery\\nfrom Amri, Kot Diji and Kalibangan.\\n6.4.3 The Malwa Culture\\nThe Malwa Culture succeeds the Kayatha and the Banas cultures. The Plateau of Malwa\\nin Central India has been described as a vast stretch of indulating plains, interspersed with\\ncuriously shaped flat topped hills and covered with tenacious black soil a very rich, loamy earth,\\npossessing and unusual power to retain moisture and renowned for its fertility (O.H.K. Spade).\\nSites of the Malwa culture have been reported both from Madhya Pradesh and\\nMaharashtra. The best known excavated sites are Eran, Nagda and Navadatoli in Madhya\\nPradesh and Inamgaon in Mahrashtra.\\nNavdatoli is one of which we have good idea because this site was extensively dug by the\\nBaroda University and the Deccan college for three seasons and full reports, are available.\\nThe Chalcolithic period of the site is divisible into four phases. Phase I is marked by\\nBanasian type of black-and-red Ware; Phase II by the Cream-slipped Ware; in Phase III appears\\nthe Black-on-Red Ware; Phase IV is characterized by a coarse red ware in association with the\\nLustrous Red Ware. But all through these four phases, the Malwa Ware continues; nor is there\\nany other significant change in the material culture of the people.\\n74\\nThe people of Navadatoli had occupied the highest terrace formed during one of the\\nphenomenal rise of the Narmada and on this were built simple, round or rectangular mud-walled\\nhuts, for which no foundation was needed. Walls generally were made of split-bamboo screens\\nplatered with mud. Cobbbles or gravels were ramed with hard compact clay for making floors\\nwhich were finally given a lime coating. Wooden posts were used to support perhaps a contical\\nroof. The houses were provided with chulhaas for cooking purposes. The available plan\\nsuggests that the chalcolithic village of Navdatoli was a nucleated settlement and on Sankalia’s\\nestimate, could possess in its earlier phase about 200 inhabitants. Unlike Eran and Nagda, the\\nChalcolithic settlement at Navdatoli does not appear to have been fortified.\\nThe prehistoric Navdatolians used varied, beautiful and infact a highly sophisticated\\npottery. The dominant pottery type was the Malwa Ware which accounts for one third of the\\ntotal pottery yield at the site. It is a painted pottery in black or brown over a buff or organge slip,\\nbut the fabric is thick to the use of chopped husk. Main shapes of the Malwa Ware are lota,\\nchannelled spouts and pedestalled goblets. The Cream-slipped Ware has some new shapes like\\nthe medium sized storage vessels and bowls, but lotas and goblets are common with the Malwa\\nWare. The pottery was beautifully decorated with geometric (lozenges and triangles) and\\nnaturalistic (human and animal) motifs.\\nA large number of stone tools consisting of pen knife blunted backed, serrated and\\nparallel-sided blades, trapezes and lunates were discovered. The evidence of copper is some-\\nwhat limited. But none the less flat copper celts with convex cutting edges, bangles, fish hooks,\\nchisels, spearhead, arrowheads and a sword with traces of a mid-rib were founded at Navdatoli.\\nExcept for the mid-ribbed sword which must have been cast, other objects appear to have been\\nhammered to shape.\\nBeads occurred profusely and were of diverse material. At Navadatoli alone, they were\\nof agate, carnelian, chalcedony, glass, jasper, lapis-lazuli, steatite, shell and terracotta.\\nTerracotta spindle whorls, animal figurines etc. were also a part of the cultural assemblage.\\nSome figurines, such as the terracotta female figurines (mother goddess) appear ritualistc.\\nShrines and animal motifs painted on jars can also provide some evidence on the religious beliefs\\nof the Navdatolians.\\nThere is also evidence regarding the food habits of the people. Besides the vegetable\\nproducts such as black gram, green gram, lentil, grass pea, linseed, ber and amla, the people ate\\nbeef, venison and pork. Charred grains of wheat, barley and rice were found but only in phase II\\nand IV.\\nIt seems that the offshoots of the Malwa culture crossed the Tapi and reached the Bhima\\nand one of the tributaries- the Ghod. In Chandoli, Songaon and Inamgoan it seems to have\\npreceded the Jorwe culture. In period III at Navadatoli, a new fabric called ‘Jorwe’ is found. It\\nis a greyish black ware. It has a well-backed core with a metallic ring, and a mat red surface.\\nThe occurrence of Jorwe pottery at Navdaroli and the Malwa ware of some sites in Maharashtra\\nsuggest interprovinical cultural contacts which might have been on ethinic and political relations\\nas well.\\n75\\nSankalia suggests that the origin of the Malwa culture can be traced to a cultural\\ninfluence from West Asia. His attention was drawn to a large variety of bowls, with or without\\nstand with a flat base, which he compares with the champagne and brandy cups of the European\\nsociety. Nothing like these appear in the Harappan sites, though one sole specimen has so far\\nbeen found from the pre-Harappan levels of Kalibangan, after which this type disappears\\ncompletely and emerges only after the Iranian contacts. Since they are a characteritic feature of\\nthe early Iranians and West Asiatic cultures to which those from Navdatoli show a great\\nresemblance in shape and design. Sankalia thinks that Navdatoli culture was in part atleast,\\nderived from or inspired by Iranian cultures. However, Dhavalikar associates the authors of the\\nMalwa culture with the Vedic Aryans.\\nThe C-14 dates assign a date bracket of 1700-1400 BCE for the Malwa culture.\\n6.4.4 The Jorwe culture\\nAfter the Harappan culture, this is the best known pre-historic culture of India. The\\nJorwe culture is named after the type-site Jorwe. The other sites representing this culture are\\nNevasa, Daimabad, Inamgaon, Chandoli, Nasik, Songaon, etc.\\nThe Jorwe culture was not the first of the earliest in Maharashtra but by about 1200 BCE\\nit had spread over Krishna-Godavari valleys ousting or incorporating within it the earlier cultural\\nmanifestations from Andhra-Karnataka in the south and Malwa in the North.\\nExtensive excavations have been carried out at Nevasa and Inamgoan. The houses there\\nwere square or rectangular with a mud wall supported by wooden posts inserted at regular\\nintervals into the floor. The roofing material was possibly bomboo matting, dry leaves etc.\\ncovered with mud. These early Jorwe houses were fairly large. Some had possibly an open\\ncourtyard where grinding of grain was done. The early Jorwe settlements at Inamgaon have all\\nthe signs of a prosperous village with a mud and stone fortification.\\nComing to Jorwe pottery, it has a fine fabric and well baked. It has a red or orange matt\\nsurface painted with geometric designs in black. However the shapes are rather limited the main\\nones being the spouted jar with a flaring mouth, the carinated bowl and the high-necked jar with\\na globular profile. There were other ceramic types as well. Bowls, lotas and globular vessels\\nrepresenting the Pale Grey Ware with white painted designs have been found at Prakash and\\nNevasa. Similarly, Daimabad, Chandoli, Sonagaon, Prakash and Inamgaon yielded many form\\nand fabrics of the Malwa Ware.\\nFor food, the inhabitants of these chalcolithic settlements cultivated barley, wheat, lentil,\\nkulith, grass pea and occasionally rice. Fruits like ber, Jamun and beheda were also grown. The\\ndomesticated animal remains of dog, elephant, horse, pig, cattle and goat, camel bones were also\\nrecovered. Amongst the wild species were black, wild buffalo, chital, sambhar and barasingha.\\nThe lithic assemblage was comprised of a few polished dolerite axes and a prolific blades\\nindustry of chalcedony. The copper objects include bangles, beads, blades, chisels, roads axes, a\\n76\\ndagger or a spear-head with a faint mid-rib and an antennae, a small pot and a few miscellaneous\\nobjects. A boat shaped kiln to smelt copper lies has been identified at Inamgaon.\\nOrnamental beads of agate, carnelian, jasper and chalcedony, gold, copper and ivory were\\nused. Bangles and anklets of copper and spiral ear ornaments of gold have also been found at\\nInamgaon.\\nSeveral burials have been reported. Both adults and children were buried with the head\\nfacing north; the adults in extended positions and the children in coarse handmade red/grey ware\\nurns placed mouth to mouth. The presence of spouted jars and bowls indicate that the dead were\\nprovided with food and drink for the afterlife.\\nThe C-14 dates suggest that the Jorwe culture is confined to circa 1400-1100 BCE though\\nat Inamgaon its late phase continues much later.\\n6.4.5 Eastern Chalcolithic cultures\\nThe eastern Chalcolithic cultures start 1600 B.C. and continue until 800 B.C. Chirand,\\nRajar Dhibi, Mahisdal, and Bharatpur are some of the important sites that have been excavated.\\nThe deposits at Chirand have been divided into 3 periods. Period I is Neolithic, Period II\\nis Chalcolithic and Period III is marked by the appearance of iron.\\nA number of bone artifacts have been found associated with Period I. They include celts,\\nscrapers, chisels, hammers, needles, points, borers, awls, shaft- straightners, styli and arrow\\nheads. Pendants, earrings, bangles, discs and combs were also made of bone.\\nBesides querns, balls and pestles, four ground stone axes were also found from Periods I\\nand II. Stone tools are of quartzite, basalt and granite. A developed microlithic industry is\\nreported. It comprised parallel sided blades, scrapers, arrowheads, serrated points, lunates,\\nborers, etc. The raw materials were chalcedony, chert, agate and jasper.\\nThe dominant pottery types are the Red ware though grey, black and black-and-red wares\\nalso occur. The main shapes are spouted vase with a narrow neck, different types of bowls,\\nbowl-with-stand, footed cup, channel spout, spoon etc. Linear designs of criss-cross lines and\\nconcentric circles were painted in red ochre after the firing of the pots, especially on grey ware.\\nPeople cultivated wheat, rice masoor and moong. River shells and snails were also eaten.\\nAnimal remains of elephant, rhino, buffalo, ox, stag and deer have been found.\\nPeriod II is marked by the occurrence of red and black-and red wares. The main types\\nare the spouted lota, lipped bowls and narrow-necked goblets. Other industries are similar to\\nPeriod II, except for the appearance of copper. Period II B marks the advents to iron.\\nOf the four periods that the deposits at Rajar Dhibi have been divided into, the first two\\nare Chalcolithic and are characterized by the occurrence of a handmade thick grey ware, a wheel\\n77\\nthrown red ware and a black-and-red ware. The lustrous red ware and channel-spouted bowls\\nhave been recovered from Period II only. The main shapes are storage jars, dishes-on stand,\\nspouted vases, bowls-on stand, lotas, high necked jars and basins.\\nTanged arrowheads, a ring, bangles, and an antimony rod are some of the copper objects\\nthat have been found The occurrence of lithic-flakes, scrapers, etc. is rare in period I but they\\noccur in large numbers in Period II.\\nA large quantity of charred rice, lunates and blades in stone, a flat copper celt, beads of\\nstone and steatite, bone combs and tetrahedral stone weights have been found at Mahisdal. The\\nceramic traditions of Period I at Mahisdal are similar to Rajar Dhibi. Period I is marked by the\\nappearance of iron.\\n(Source: V.K.

Name at least three important sites representing the eastern Chalcolithic cultures that\\nhave been excavated.\\n6.5 Neolithic settlements of North-Western Frontier and Kashmir\\nIn the North-Western Frontier the sequence is built up on the basis of excavations at\\nGhaligai cave and a number of grave sites such as Timargarha, Aligrama, etc. all in Swat. In the\\nGhaligai cave the lowest levels produced coarse handmade pottery. According to the Allchins,\\nin Swat there is clear evidence that in period IV of Ghaligai cave, a new element entered the\\nvalley, associated with, the Gandharan graves and bringing a marked increase in the use of\\ncopper and bronze, distinctive burial rites and a cult of fire, inferred by the presence of some\\ncremations, etc. The parallels for the material culture are in the Caucasus, north Iran and\\nsouthern central Asia.\\nThe best known Neolithic site in Kashmir is at Burzahom. The deposits at Burzhom have\\nbeen divided into four periods, out of which the first two are Neolithic, the third Megalithic and\\nthe last, early historic.\\nThe most distinctive trait of Period I is pit dwelling. Both circular/oval and\\nrectangular/squarish pits were used. Charcoal ash, potsherds etc. were found from these pits.\\nPolished axes, harvester pounders polishers, chisels and maceheads were the main stone tool\\ntypes in use. The bone tool industry comprised harpoons, needles, awls, spearpoints, arrowheads,\\ndaggers and scrapers. No burials were found in Period I. Pots of various colours ranging from\\nsteel grev to brown were found. These were made over mats and were occasionally decorated\\nwith incised and notched designs.\\nPeriod II is marked by the occurrence of mud and mud-brick houses and some new\\nshapes of pottery. These new shapes comprised dishes with hollow stand, globular pots, jars,\\nstems, with triangular perforation and a funnel shaped vase. The pottery was still handmade and\\nit is only towards the close of this period that a wheelmade red-ware pot containing 950 beads of\\n79\\nagate and carnelian was found. In stone and bone industries there is continuity from Period I,\\nthough the tools are better finished and larger in number.\\nA general bracket of 2400-1500 BCE is given to the Burzahom Neolithic culture.\\n6.6 Neolithic -Chalcolithic culture of the South\\nExcavations carried out at sites like Brahmagiri, Maski, Piklihal, Sangankallu,\\nTekkalakota, Hallur, Utnur, T. Narsipur and Kupgal give an idea of the Neolithic chalcolithic\\nculture of the South.\\nAs known from the excavations at Hallpur, Tekkalakota and Sangankullu, the huts were\\ngenerally circular, of one room, with a low mud plinth, fortified by a split bamboo screen and a\\nconical thatched roof. The floors were occasionally white-washed with lime. Storage jars and\\nchulahs (hearths) were common finds in such houses.\\nBowls of various shapes; shallow dishes, lipped, lugged, spouted, channel spouted\\nhandled and hollow-footed bowls; jars; dishes on stand; and perforated pots are the main shapes\\nof Neolithic Phase I pottery. All pottery of this phase was handmade. The unburnished grey and\\nbrown wares of phase I disappear in the second phase and even the burnished grey ware occurs\\nrarely. Phase II is marked by the appearance of a dull red ware with painting in black or violet\\nand a black-and-red ware, occasionally painted.\\nAmong the tools, the axes are the most common. Other stone tool types are adzes,\\nscrapers, chisels, wedges, picks, borers, hammer stones, sling stones, querns, etc.\\nThe available C-14 dates show that the Southern Neolithic time-spread is confined to\\ncirca 2500-1000 BCE.\\n6.7 Conclusion\\nFrom the beginning of the first millennium B.C. iron came to be known to different\\ncultures, for example the Painted Grey Ware culture of the Upper Ganga Valley as also the\\nculture of the megalith-builders of peninsular India. Thus, began a period of greater interaction\\namong various communities; a period in which much of the base of modern village India was\\nlaid.\\nCheck your progress exercise 3\\nA.

The Vedic tradition is\\nbelieved to have contained in it the essence of Indian social and cultural life. Some believe that\\neverything emerging from history, philosophy, mathematics to poltical ideas in India are seen to\\nemanate from Vedic sources, and hence the essence of Indianness. Understandings of the Vedic\\nliterature and its bearing on Indian history have generated immense debates. Questions of\\nantiquity, authorship and spatial character and the people figuring in the literature are relevant to\\na student of history.\\nThe “Vedic age” constructed on this literary tradition has carried different labels like ‘the\\niron age India’, ‘the second urbanization’ and ‘the Gangetic culture’. The designation ‘Vedic\\nculture’ points to the main trajectory of historical development. It is important to note that the\\nnotion that the ancient Indian cities of the Indus were destroyed by invaders (Aryan?) has lost\\ncredibility. It is true that the high, urban culture spread over north-west of the subcontinent for a\\nmillennium disappeared by 1000 BCE.\\n7.2 The Aryan Question\\nThere are more than a dozen theories about the original home of the Aryans or Indo-\\nEuropeans, and many views on the different routes they followed. Initially, the term ‘Arya’ was\\nassociated with the people who spoke Vedic and Avestan languages, but gradually speakers of\\nentire Indo-European languages came to be recognized as Aryans. Historians have determined\\nthe main traits of Aryan culture on the basis of Vedic, Iranian and Greek literary texts and\\ncognate terms found in the Proto-Indo-European languages. The Vedic texts give us information\\nthat enables a historian to reconstruct the main features of material life and culture of Indo-Aryan\\npeople for some eight hundred years (circa 1500-700 BCE). The texts were memorized and\\norally transmitted and writing was not used to confidently declare it as ‘recorded history’. In\\nsuch a situation, it is difficult to match ‘historical cultures’ with ‘archaeological cultures. At best,\\narchaeology is useful in setting chronological limits for undated texts, through use of the\\ngeography of the texts and the appearance of iron. The Vedic corpus gives us a picture of a non-\\nurban and scriptless society.\\n7.2.1 Markers of the Aryan culture and its geographical distribution\\nR.S. Sharma in his India’s Ancient Past (Chapter 11) has outlined the principal traits of\\nAryan culture on the basis of Vedic, Iranian and Greek literary texts. He has discussed about the\\nhorse, its domestication and diffusion, the war chariot, spoked wheels, pit-dwelling, birch (birch-\\nwood), cremation, fire cult, animal sacrifice including horse sacrifice, the cult of Soma and the\\nsvastika.\\n83\\nThe Sanskrit term ‘asva’ and its cognates are frequently found in Avestan, Greek, Latin\\nand other Indo-European languages. The horse is praised in the family books of the Rig Veda.\\nAlmost all the Vedic gods were associated with this animal. The sun is often described as swift-\\nhorsed or one possessing swift horses. In Avesta, the adjective ‘swift-horsed’ is applied to a\\ndivinity called Apaam-Napaat, who is also a Vedic deity associated with antariksha (space).\\nArchaeologically, the horse first appears in the south Ural region around 600 BCE. In fourth\\nmillennium BCE, the horse appears in Anatolia (modern Turkey). But the effective advent of the\\nhorse is ascribed to the Kassite invasion of Babylonia in 1595 BCE. This evidence emphatically\\nproves that the epicenter of domestication of horse was outside Indian subcontinent. Its diffusion\\nwas from west to east.\\nHistorians and archaeologists who believed that India was the original home of the\\nAryans have given the theory of Harappan culture as Rig Vedic and the river Sarasvati based\\nculture. According to S.P Gupta, “The Indus-Sarasvati civilization represents one very important\\naspect of the developed Vedic civilization.” He argues that the Harappan culture was the gift of\\nboth the rivers (Indus and Sarasvati) and perhaps more of the Sarasvati river. There is no doubt\\nabout the reference to the river Sarasvati in the Rig Veda as Nanditama (river par-excellence or\\nthe best of all rivers) in several suktas. The real question is, which was the earliest Sarasvati?\\nWhether it was Helmand river in Afghanistan (called as Harakhwati in Avesta) or the Hakkara\\nand Ghaggar. This happened in the case of the river Sarayu also. It is probable that when the\\nsettlers migrated, they carried the names of the river also with them. R.S. Sharma has observed\\nthat the archaeological counterpart of the early Vedic culture appears not in Harappa but in the\\nborderland cultures of the Swat valley, Gomal valley and Pirak complex, and perhaps in Periano\\nGhundai. According to him, it emerges clearly in South Central Asia in the Bactria-Margiana\\nArchaeological Complex and in the culture of Tajikistan. Any effort to push back the chronology\\nof traits, ignoring the elements of change in them is seen as a frenzied hunt for antiquity and\\nadventurism by some scholars. In their opinion, it would remain a figment of imagination\\nwithout support of solid evidence.\\nThe fire cult is considered to be a special trait of Indo-Aryans and common with Indo-\\nIranians as well. The term ‘Vedi’ for the fire altar is mentioned in the Rig Veda. Avesta gives\\nimportance to fire worship. The fire altars discovered in the Harappan context do not match\\neither with age-old traditional practices or with textual prescriptions. Connected with this is the\\nanimal sacrifice and horse sacrifice. The French Vedic scholar Louis Renon considers horse\\nsacrifice as an Indo-European ritual on the basis of archaeological evidence across eastern,\\ncentral, western and northern Europe. Two hymns in the tenth book of the Rig Veda are devoted\\nto horse sacrifice while the later Vedic texts transform the sacrifice to asvamedha.\\nArchaeological evidence of horse sacrifice is wanting in India.\\n84\\n7.3 The Rig Veda\\nThe Rig Veda is considered to be the earliest specimen of the Indo-European languages.\\nIt is a collection of prayers offered to Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Soma and other gods by\\nseveral families of poets or sages. It consists of ten mandalas or books, of which Books II to VII\\nform its earliest portions and are called family books. Books I and X seems to have been the\\nlatest additions. Book X which is known as the Purusa Sukta is the latest addition and in fact,\\ndoes not form the portion of the original Rig Veda. The family books do not contain purely\\nVedic or Aryan traditions. Even in these books Vedic and non-Vedic traditions are mixed up.\\nBook III, which is supposed to have been composed by Visvamitra is such good example of this\\nmixing up of cultural traits.\\nThe Rig Veda has several things in common with the Zind Avesta, which is the oldest\\ntext in the Iranian language. The two texts use the same names for several gods and for social\\nclasses. The geographical distribution of the early portion of the Rig Veda has been assigned to\\nthe land of the seven rivers (Sapt saindhava pradesh). This area mostly covers Punjab, but its\\ndating is not so easy. Several theories discuss the sites and antiquities attributable to the Aryans.\\nAs Aryans built their houses of timber or mud it makes it difficult to identify their remains in a\\ntropical area. It is said that the Aryans used horses and war chariots fitted with copper or bronze.\\nBut the archaeological excavations have not revealed their vehicles. Stuart Piggot mentions five\\nBronze Age graves in the Urals containing lightly built wooden vehicles of cart or chariot type.\\nTheir dates have been assigned to a date around 1500 BCE A.H. Dani refers to the use of horse\\ndrawn chariots used in western Asia around 1800 BCE In the Indian subcontinent, we have\\nnoticed the remains of the horse in some Gandhara graves belonging to 2000 BCE Some Aryan\\nnames mentioned in the Kassite inscription of about 1600 BCE and the Mitanni inscriptions of\\nabout 1400 BCE discovered in Iraq have been used as the chief means of dating the Rig Veda.\\nThe much talked of excavations at four sites-- Bhagwanpura (Kurukshetra district) Dadheri\\n(Ludhiana district), Katpalan and Nagar (Jullundur/Jalandhar district) have also been considered\\nto fix the chronology of the Rig Veda. The dates assigned to these four sites range from 1500\\nBCE to 1300 BCE which more or less corresponds to the date assigned to the Rig Veda.\\nCheck your progress exercise 1\\nA.

The\\nearliest wave is represented by the Rig Vedic people, who appeared in the subcontinent in about\\n1500 BCE. They came into conflict with the original inhabitants called the dasas, dasyus, etc. As\\nthe dasas are also referred to in the earliest Iranian literature, they are considered to have been a\\nbranch of the early Aryans. The war lord of Rig Vedic Aryan i.e. Indra led many battles against\\ndasas, dasyus and panis. The dasyus seem to have been original inhabitants of India and an\\nAryan chief who conquered them was hailed as trasadasyu. But dasyu corresponds to dahyu in\\nthe Iranian language. Emile Benveniste believes that although the term dasyu-hatya occurs\\nfrequently and they seem to have been bitter enemy of the Rig Vedic people, Iranian evidence\\nsuggests otherwise. Perhaps dasyu or dahyus were one of the earliest waves to cross the\\nHindukush. It is a well known fact that inter and intra-tribal conflicts rocked the Aryan\\ncommunities for quite a considerable time. The case of the Battle of ten kings or dasarajna\\nfought on the river Ravi, mentioned in Book VII, is too well known. The Bharata ruling clan was\\nopposed by a host of ten kings, five or whom were heads of Aryan tribals and the remaining five\\nof Non-Aryan peoples. This famous battle gave victory of Sudas and established the supremacy\\nof the Bharatas. Amongst the defeated Aryan tribes, the most important was the Purus. Gradually\\nthe Bharatas joined hands with the Purus and they together formed a new famous ruling tribe\\nknown as Kurus. During the later Vedic times, Kurus combined with the Panchalas and they\\ntogether ruled in the upper Ganga valley. In addition to this story we hear of numerous other\\nconflicts between Vedic tribes and non-Vedic tribes. But R.S. Sharma suggests that the overtones\\nof racial conflict between the Aryans and the non-Aryans given to these conflicts by some Indian\\nand foreign scholars is unwarranted. He further states that in spite of diligent diggings for the last\\nthree decades, it has not been possible to adduce proof of mass scale confrontation between the\\nRig Vedic people and the original inhabitants of north-western India.\\n7.4.1 Rig Vedic Economy\\nThe careful study of Rig Veda clearly indicates that the Rig Vedic economy was\\npredominantly pastoral. But it does not mean that in the sequence of social evolution nomadism\\nand pastoralism preceded agricultural society. Archaeological evidence related to north western\\npart of the sub-continent suggest different story. However, the family books show the Rig Vedic\\npeople to be primarily pastoral people. The wild animals (mrga) is differentiated from the\\n86\\ndomesticated animals (pasu), mainly cattle which were evidently valued for food as well as for\\ndairy products. The cow is most favourite animal of the Rig Vedic people. This animal is par-\\nexcellence amongst all the cattle. The early Aryans’ every sphere of life is overshadowed by this\\nanimal. The term for cow (gau) occurs 176 times in the family books of the Rig Veda. Cattle\\nwere considered to be synonymous with wealth (rayi) and a wealthy person was known as\\ngomat. The terms gavisti, gosu, gavyat, gavyu, gavesana, gavyuti, gojat and gotra etc., which\\ncover several aspects of cattle rearing and social organization of the Rig Vedic people are\\nfrequently mentioned in the original portions of the Rig Veda. Even buffalo is described as\\ngaurigavala. In the Aryan life of the family, the significance of cow is shown by the use of the\\nterm duhitr (one who milks), for daughter.\\nThe horse is another important animal reared by the early Aryans. As we have discussed\\nearlier, it is considered as an indispensable marker of the Aryan culture. The popular term for\\nhorse asva and its cognates are frequently referred to in Sanskrit, Avestan, Greek, Latin and\\nother European languages. Morton Smith in his famous article. ‘What is in a name (in Ancient\\nIndia)’? states that in ancient texts, particularly in Vedic and Avestan, several personal names are\\nhorse-based. He has enumerated such 50 horse names and 20 chariot names referred to in the\\nabove texts. The term asva and its various terms occurs 215 times in the Rig Veda, Even the term\\ngau occurs 176 times and vrsbha 170 times. It is suggested that the Rig Vedic cattle-rearing\\nsociety was dominated by the horse-riding cheiftancy. The horse is praised in two detailed\\nhymns of the Rig Veda. No God could afford to be without the association of this powerful and\\nshining animal. Indra and his companions Maruts are often shown riding horses in battles as well\\nas in sports.\\nIt is interesting to notice common terms for cattle and pasture in several Indo European\\nlanguages. Special mention may be made of the term pasti found in Slavic, and its cognates in\\nSerbo-Croatian, Bahemian, Russian and Polish. The terms pasti or paste have been referred to in\\nthe Rumanian and Rig Vedic texts. R.S. Sharma has enumerated the term pastya 18 times in the\\nRig Veda. Several forms of this term include pastya, pastya-sad, pastya-vat, pastya-vati and\\npastya-van. The frequent use of the term vraj in the early portion of the Rig Veda also indicates\\nthe pastoral life of the people. Vraj means cow-pen. In its different forms, this term occurs 45\\ntimes in the Rig Veda.\\nUnfortunately, archaeological evidence regarding dominant pastoral life of the Rig Vedic\\npeople are scanty. If we accept four important archaeological sites, namely, Bhagwanpura,\\nDadheri, Katpalan and Nagar as reflecting Rig Vedic material culture, then we may have some\\nglimpses of pastoral life indicated by the findings of cattle-bones. A good amount of animal\\nbones has been discovered at Bhagwanpura and Dadheri.\\nThese include charred bones of cattle, sheep and goats, which were evidently used for\\nfood. Sharp cut marks on their bones corroborates this assumption. Literary evidence clearly\\nshows that cattle, sheep and goats were domesticated for purposes both of dairy products and\\nmeat.\\nIt seems that the Rig Vedic people possessed knowledge of agriculture. There are 21\\nreferences to agricultural activities in the Rig Veda, but only a few occur in its family books the\\n87\\nterm krs (to cultivate) occurs rarely in its kernel. The term Krsti is referred to 33 times in the Rig\\nVeda but it is used in the sense of people, and five peoples (pancakrstyah) are mentioned two\\ntimes. This reminds us of later use of panca janah and pancacarsaniyah. The popular term hala\\ndoes not find place in the Rig Veda, but two other terms for plough, langala and sira, occur in\\nthe earliest books. The terms phala or ploughshare and furrows (Sita) is mentioned in Book IV,\\nwhere a complete hymn is devoted to agricultural operations. But this book is considered late\\nportion of the Rig Veda. Marks of furrows belonging to pre-Harappan period have been\\ndiscovered in Kalibanga and the pre-Aryan practice may have been adopted by the Vedic people.\\nIt is said that the ploughshare mentioned in the Rig Veda were probably wooden ploughshare\\nused in cultivating lands which were rendered fertile on accounts of floods in the seven rivers of\\nPunjab although early Aryans seem to have been acquainted with sowing, harvesting, threshing\\nand possessed the knowledge about different seasons, yet, their primitive means of production\\ncould not allow them to support a large number of people. In the age of the Rig Veda, yava or\\nbarley was produced. Barley ripens quickly and does not require much rain. It was perhaps, used\\nfor both the purposes of food as well as fodder. Rig Vedic people also grew some other coarse\\ngrains but they were definitely not aware of growing rice (vrhi). Thus, the lack of knowledge of\\ngrowing a variety of crops and primitive agricultural technology prevented them to become\\nessentially an agricultural society.\\n7.4.2 Rig Vedic Society\\nThe terms vra, vrata, vraj, sardha and grama mentioned in the early portion of the Rig\\nVeda have been explained as suggesting the existence of ‘band’ system in the age of Rig Veda. It\\nis argued that these terms seem to be connected with two important sources of the livelihood of\\nthe Rig Vedic people, namely fighting, which meant ‘booty production’ and cattle rearing which\\nsupplied them with dairy products and food. Perhaps such terms was formed for fighting for\\nlivelihood, and once it assumed a permanent character it probably came to be considered as a\\nkinship group. R.S. Sharma is of the view that ‘although some references from the Rig Veda may\\nindicate survivals of ‘band’ system, by and large the tribal element was strong in the Rigvedic\\nsociety. He further argues that frequent occurrence of various terms such as jana, vis, gana,\\ngram, grha, kula, vrat etc., which stand for kin-based units, suggest strong tribal elements in the\\nearly vedic society. The terms jana occurs 275 times, vis 171 times and grama 13 times in the\\nRig Veda. Romila Thapar also agrees with this kind of interpretations of these terms. But she\\nemphasizes on kin-based, lineage-based or segmentary form of society in the Rig Vedic Age.\\nAccording to social anthropologists, tribe is the largest unit of lineage-based or segmentary\\nsociety and kinship is the unifying bond between them.\\nSome social anthropologists such as Emmanuel Terray and Marcael Mauss etc. have\\ndiscovered the practice of redistribution. Romila Thapar has examined in detail the prevalence of\\nthis system in the Vedic period. She states that the system of dana and dakshina functioned as\\neconomic exchange during the tribal phase of the Vedic society. Some other Indian scholars have\\nalso investigated the practice of distribution and redistribution at one point of time in the age of\\nthe Rig Veda. Spoils of war, or gifts and occasional tributes were certainly redistributed. They\\nlargely consisted of cattle, sheep, goats, horses, weapons and most importantly women slaves.\\nWomen were also an important gain of spoils of wars.\\n88\\nThe nomadic or migratory nature of the early Aryan is indicated by the use of term vis in\\nthe sense of entering or settling in the Rig Veda. Several prefixes such as a vis, upavis, nivis,\\npunarvis, pravis, etc., added to the term vis to form verbs also suggest migratory nature of the\\nRig Vedic tribes. These habits of people in a predominantly pastoral or cattle-rearing society\\nconstitute a natural phenomenon.\\n\\uf0b7 The Position of Women in the Rig Vedic Society\\nWhat was the status of women in the Rig Vedic society? While there has been constant\\nattempt to eulogize their position, it is likely that reality may have not been so simple. The term\\nduhitr indicates some kind of role of women in the productive process. The frequent references\\nto the role of women in weaving activities also strengthen this argument. A women distributor\\nnamely Sanugi is also mentioned in the Rig Veda. Further we have references to women seers of\\nVedic hymns and child-marriage was unknown. The term dampti has been explained as the equal\\nsharing of the house hold property by wife and husband. It seems that women were given due\\nregards during the early times of the Rig Vedic society. This was due to their larger involvement\\nin the productive system of the society. But at later stage, when they were deprived of their\\nproductive role, their position started gradually declining. It can be seen that while there are\\nprayers in the Rig Veda for birth of brave sons in particular, or praja or offspring in general,\\nthere are none for daughters. On divine plane male divinity dominated the horizon. The\\nmasculinity of Indra is eulogized. Some of these instances indicate matrilineal traces, and we\\nhave a few examples of sons being named after their mother, as in the case of Mamateya. The\\nearly Aryans seem to have adopted this practice from the non-Aryans.\\n\\uf0b7 The division based on occupations\\nThe Rig Vedic society which was predominantly a pastoral and tribal in nature and which\\ncould not to produce surplus did not create conditions for class differentiation. There could be\\ndifferentiation of rank, as can be inferred from the titles of tribal chiefs such as vishpati,\\nvishampati, jansya gopa, ganashya raja, gananam ganpati etc. It is correct to postulate on the\\nbasis of famous dansutimandala of the Rig Veda that the society represented at least in that\\nstratum was not completely egalitarian, but the phenomenon of the upper classes living on the\\nlabour of tribesmen was just beginning to emerge. The ritualistic and ideological ratification\\nmentioned in the Purusa sukta in the tenth mandala came at a much later stage. There is no denial\\nthat the division based on occupations had started. But this division was in its rudimentary form.\\nWe hear of a famous statement of a family member wherein he asserts that he is a poet, his father\\nis a physician, and his mother is grinder. Earning livelihood through different means, they live\\ntogether. The brahmana is mentioned 14 times and kshatriya 9 times in the Rig Veda. But most\\nof these references are found in the later portions of the Rig Veda. The shudra is mentioned for\\nthe first and last time in the Purusha Sukta (tenth mandala) of the Rig Veda. Thus, the later\\nnotion of varna system based on exploitative mode of production is not to be found in the Rig\\nvedic society. We find domestic slaves, but not the wage earner or even beggars. Tribal traits in\\nsociety were predominant and stronger. Social stratification based on collection of taxes or\\naccumulation of landed properly were completely absent. Due to serious constraints in\\nproductive mechanism, society still remained tribal and largely egalitarian.\\n89\\n7.4.3 Rig Vedic Polity\\nUnfortunately we do not get clear picture of administrative machinery in the Rig Vedic\\nperiod. It seems that the king or Rajanya was the epicenter of the administrative or political\\npower. This was primarily due to his major role in the success of his clan in the war. Some early\\nportions of the Rig Veda show that the king was elected on the merit of his role in the war and\\nother virtues. But later on his post had become hereditary. However, the king was not allowed to\\nexercise unlimited power. The popular tribal assembly samiti successfully controlled his\\nactivities. His major duties were to protect his tribe, protect its cattle, fight its wars and offer\\nprayers to gods on behalf of his whole tribal community.\\nWe get references to some tribal or clan based assemblies such as the sabha, samiti,\\nvidatha, gana etc., in the Rig Veda. They exercised deliberative, military and religious functions.\\nThe vidatha functioned as an excellent tribal politico-economic organization for the distribution\\nand redistribution activities. Sometimes women played an important role in the functioning of\\nthis organization. But the two most important assemblies were the sabha and samiti. Sometimes\\nwomen also attended the sabha. These two assemblies were so powerful and prestigious that the\\nchiefs or the kings always showed eagerness to win over the support of the members of these\\nassemblies. It seems that the sabha was represented by few respected and wise elders and it\\nlooked after mainly social and religious problems. Samiti was most powerful tribal assembly\\nwhich dealt with administrative and political activities. Its members elected the king and\\ncontrolled his other activities. When the post of king or rajanya became hereditary, the power of\\nthis assembly began to decline.\\nIn routine administrative work, the king was assisted by a few functionaries. The\\npurohita seems to have been most important functionary amongst all. We hear of the two famous\\npurohita, Vasistha and Vishvamitra, in the Rig Vedic period. Their main duty was to inspire the\\ntribal chief to action in wars and lauded their exploits in return for handsome rewards in cattle,\\nmetals, clothes and women slaves. Senani seems to have been another important functionary,\\nwho used spears, axes, swords, etc. in the wars. But we do not come across any administrative\\nfunctionary for collecting the tax, probably the rajanya or chiefs received from the people\\nvoluntary gifts called bali. Bali was evidently received both from vis of one’s own gana as well\\nas from hostile people who were subjugated. It is said that the gods when pleased with offerings\\nor bali, grant the sacrificer his desires for cattle, horses sons, victory in raids etc. The Rig Veda\\ndoes not refer to any functionary for administrating justice. But it does not mean that the Rig\\nVedic society was free of theft, burglary and other petty crimes. We often hear of theft. The king\\ndid not maintain any regular army, but in times of war he mustered a militia whose military\\nfunctions were performed by different tribal groups such as vrata, gana, grama, sardha etc. It is\\nrightly argued that the Rig Vedic society had a tribal system of government in which the military\\nelement was dominant feature. The lack of civil system or territorial administration was due to\\nconstant migratory or nomadic nature of the Rig Vedic people.\\n90\\n7.4.4 Rig Vedic Religion\\nRig Vedic religion was evolved from its overwhelming tribal surroundings. The early\\nAryans found it difficult to explain the advent of rains, the appearance of the sun and the moon,\\nand the existence of the rivers and mountains etc. So these natural forces were personified and\\ngiven human or animal attributes. The poets of various families offered prayers in their honour.\\nIndra is most important divinity in the Rig Veda. He is also called purandara or literally breaker\\nof forts. According to D.D. Kosambi, a leading Marxist historian, Rig Vedic Aryans demolished\\nthe forts of Harappan cities under the divine leadership of this war-lord. He led the Aryan\\nsoldiers to victory against panis and other demons. Two hundred and fifty hymns are devoted to\\nhim. He is also considered as the rain god and to be responsible for causing rainfall. The later\\nstory of Krisna protecting the people of Mathura from excessive rain havoc created by angry\\nIndra seems to have its earlier origin. But by this time he had lost his past glory and only his\\nstatus of rain god remained intact.\\nAgni (fire-god) is the second most important god mentioned in the Rig Veda. Fire played\\na vital role in the life of primitive people because of its use in burning forests, cooking etc. The\\ncult of fire occupied a central place not only in India but also in Iran. About 200 hymns are\\ndevoted to this god in the Rig Veda. In the Vedic period, Agni acted as a kind of intermediary\\nbetween the gods on the one hand and the people on the other. The oblation offered to Agni were\\nsupposed to be carried in the form of smoke to the sky, and thus conveyed to the gods. Agni is\\nbutter-backed, butter-faced and beautiful tongued. He is the eagle of the sky and a divine bird.\\nHis flames are like the roaring waves of the sea. More generally Agni is spoken of as born in\\nwood as the embryo of plants or as distributed in plants. The terrestrial existence of Agni is\\nfurther indicated by his being called the navel of the earth; Agni is celebrated and worshipped by\\nVaruna, Mitra, the Maruts, and all the gods.\\nVaruna, shown by the side of Indra, is the next important god in the Rig Veda. Two\\ndozen hymns have been devoted to this god. It seems that this god occupied third important\\nposition in the Rig Veda. Varuna personified water. He was supposed to uphold the natural\\norder, and whatever happened in the universe was thought to be the reflection of his desires.\\nSoma was regarded to be the god of plants, and an intoxicating drink is named after him. 114\\nhymns have been devoted to this god. The Soma sacrifice forms the main feature of the ritual of\\nthe Rig Veda, when drunk by Indra soma caused the sun to rise in heaven. Etymologically Soma-\\nHaoma means ‘pressed juice’, being derived from the root su-hu ‘to press’.\\nThe Maruts personify the storm. 33 hymns have been dedicated to this god. Maruts are\\nclosely associated with the goddess Rodasi. She has been regarded as their beautiful bride. Thus\\nRig Veda refers to a large number of gods, who represent the different forces of nature in one\\nform or another, but are also attributed human activities.\\nThe Rig Veda refers to several female divinities such as Usas, Aditi, Surya etc. Usas,\\ngoddess of dawn, is celebrated in about 20 hymns of the Rig Veda and mentioned more than 300\\ntimes. But these females divinities were not so prominent in the Rig Vedic period. The male gods\\novershadowed the religious horizon of the Rig Vedic society.\\n91\\nThe popular mode of worshipping the gods was through the recitation of prayers and\\noffering of sacrifices. Both collective and individual prayers were made. It seems that prayers\\nwere offered to gods in chorus by members of a whole tribe. The Rig Vedic tribal society did not\\nworship gods for their spiritual uplift or for ending the miseries of life. They wanted to enjoy\\nevery bit of their life. For this enjoyment, they needed praja (children), pasu (cattle), food,\\nwealth (rayi) and health. The complex rituals and magical power of the words were required in\\nthe stratified society of the later Vedic age.\\nCheck your progress exercise 2\\nA.

The\\nliterary sources are comprised of the Vedic texts which were compiled after the age of the Rig\\nVeda and the archaeological sources pertain to the Painted Grey Ware phase.\\n\\uf0b7 Literary Sources\\nThe Sama Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Atharva Veda, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and\\nthe Upanisads constitute the later Vedic Samhitas. Sama Veda is perhaps the oldest Aryan\\npoetical treatise based on musical tunes. For purposes of signing, the prayers of the Rig Veda\\nwere set to tune in this Veda. The Yajur Veda contains hymns as well as detail and complicated\\nformulae for conducting numerous rituals. These rituals not only throw light on religions\\npractices but also reflect the social and political background which helped them to emerge and\\ngrow. The Atharva Veda reflects the horizon of composite culture of the Vedic and non-Vedic\\ntimes. It contains charms and spells to ward off evils and diseases. The famous Prithvi Sukta of\\nthis Veda reveals the non-vedic practices of fertility-cult and matrilineal traits. The Vedic\\nSamhitas were followed by the composition of a series of text known as Brahmanas. These\\nBrahamanas are the invaluable literary source of the later Vedic period. The ritualistic formulae\\ncontained in them not only explain socio- religious functions but also throw light on economic\\nactivities of their times. The Aranyakas were perhaps composed by the Vedic seers living in the\\nfourth stage of their life in the forests. They contain the bitter and sweet experiences of their life\\n92\\nwitnessed in the earlier three stages. The Upanishads deal with the metaphysical aspects of the\\nlife of the later Vedic Aryans. The sophisticated and complex philosophical debates and\\ndiscussions are the main theme of these texts. All these Vedic texts were compiled in the Indo-\\nGangetic divide and the upper Gangetic basin in circa 1000-600 BCE. The geographical\\ndistribution forms the major portion of western UP, almost the whole of Haryana, and the\\nneighbouring parts of the Punjab and Rajasthan. It is postulated that from the climatic point of\\nview this whole area constitutes one unit having the same kinds of plants and trees.\\n\\uf0b7 Archaeological Sources\\nIt has been argued that the material background of the social evolution in the first half of\\nthe first millennium BCE in the Indo-Gangetic divide and the upper Ganga valley is provided by\\nthe Painted Grey Ware culture and especially by the first phase of iron using culture. The PGW\\nsites are spread from northern most sites at Mandu in Jammu. Ujjain is in south and Bikaner in\\nthe west to the Vaisali (Bihar) in east. But its main centeres of production seem to be the basins\\nof Sutlej and upper Ganga valley. More then 750 sites of the PGW culture have been excavated\\nin this area.\\nIt seems that there had been a change and re-grouping of tribes of the Rig Veda, and\\nmany new tribes. Aryans and non-Aryans emerged during this period. The Bharatas and the\\nPurus, the two prominent tribes, combined and thus formed the Kurus, who with their allies, the\\nPanchalas, became the formidable tribe group. It seems that in the beginning the Kurus settled\\nthemselves between the Sarasvati and Drisadvati just on the fringe of the doab. Soon the Kurus\\noccupied Delhi and the upper portion of the Gangetic plains the area called Kurukshetra or the\\nland of the Kurus. The centre of culture gradually shifted eastwards and become localized in the\\nupper and middle portions of the doab, covering the modern districts of Bareilly, Badaun and\\nFarukhabad that produced the most learned brahamanas and philosopher kings of the later Vedic\\ntimes. It is interesting to note that it is precisely this area which has yielded the maximum\\nnumber of iron-weapons and tools. Thus it is the land of the Kuru-pancalas which has\\narchaeologically shown a denser population living on assured and continuous means of\\nsubsistence. The average distance between the one Painted Grey Ware site and another is nearly\\n8 kilometers, which is an indication of greater density of population in comparison to other-areas\\nwhere PGW layers have been unearthed. The distance is still less between the sites on the bank\\nof the river Yamuna. Further easterly direction shows concentration of the more PGW sites with\\nthe solitary exception of the Ghaziabad district, where there are nearly 7 sites within the radius of\\nten miles. The PGW iron phase deposits in this area, which are said to have been 3 to 4 metres\\ndeep at several places, makes our point more clear that these settlements lasted for at least three\\nto four centuries. Their relative stableness and richer material content indicating an increase in\\npopulation suggest that they were inhabited by agrarian society. It seems quite plausible that\\nwhen the later Vedic people migrated towards more fertile and monsoon-fed easterly direction\\nthe north and west (particularly Punjab) not only declined in importance, but the inhabitants of\\nthis area were looked down upon with disapproval.\\n93\\n7.5.2 The Iron Technology and its Impact\\nThe PGW archaeology clearly shows that iron weapons such as arrow-heads-and spear\\nheads came to be commonly used in western UP from about 800 BCE onwards. These iron-\\nweapons may have helped the Kurupancalas to establish their political supremacy over their\\nadversaries living in this area. The iron axe may have been used to clear the forests in the upper\\ngangetic basin. Towards the end of the later Vedic period knowledge of iron spread in eastern\\nUP and Videha region of Bihar. The earliest iron implements unearthed in this area belong to the\\n7th century BCE. It is interesting to note that reference to this black metal in the later-Vedic texts\\nbelonging to this period increased many-folds. The most important Brahamanas i.e. the\\nSatapatha Brahmana emphatically asserts that the iron is the back-bone of the peasantry. It shows\\nthat iron began to play an important role even in agricultural operations. The Atharva Veda and\\nAitareya Brahmana refer to this metal as syam ayas or Krishna ayas. Although few agricultural\\ntools made of iron have been found, undoubtedly agriculture became the chief source of\\nlivelihood of the later Vedic people. The Satapatha Brahmana gives a detailed account of\\nagricultural operations. It refers to six, eight, twelve and even twenty four oxen yoked to the\\nplough. The other Brahmanas have also mentioned ploughing rituals.\\n7.5.3 Later Vedic Economy\\nThe study of the later Vedic texts shows that people produced not only barley, which is\\nfrequently mentioned in the Rig Veda, but also wheat, several kinds of pulses and above all,\\nmany kinds of rice as well. The Aitaraya Brahmana refers to atleast six kinds of rice. Besides\\nbarley rice and wheat have been found in the PGW levels at Atranjikhera. Bean pulse (masa) and\\nseasum (tila), millet (syamaka) etc. are also mentioned in the later Vedic text. The cultivation of\\nrice in the upper Gangetic basin suggests that in ancient times this area had a heavier rainfall and\\nmuch waterlogging. It is interesting to note that wheat has no significant place in the Vedic\\nritual. It has rather been condemned as the food of mlechha (non-Aryan). The Panchavimsa\\nBrahmana refers to barley and rice as the source of life (pransaya pranah). The later Vedic texts\\nstate that the use of rice immortalized the yajman (the person who performs the yajna). It is\\nknown as akshat – meaning indestructible. The cultivation of variety of crops suggest more than\\nsusbsistence economy. Peasants started producing a little more than what they needed to support\\nthemselves. Now they could maintain non-producing section such as priests and princesses and\\neven some other professional groups which had just started to emerge during this period. R.S.\\nSharma is of the opinion that although the practice of agriculture has increased many folds it was\\nstill in primitive stage. Ploughing was done with the help of the wooden shares possibly having\\niron tips on them. This could possibly work in the light soil of the upper Gangetic plains. Thus\\naccording to Sharma the later Vedic society was a small scale non-monetary peasant society and\\nnot a full-fledged class society. He further states that the limited availability of agricultural\\nsurplus on account of wooden plough share based agriculture and indeterminate killing of cattle\\nin sacrifices, could not sharpen class antagonism. But it is beyond doubt that the booty capture,\\ncattle rearing and semi-nomadic tribal society of the Rig Veda was transformed into a sedentary\\npeasant society in this period.\\nThe later Vedic period also witnessed the emergence of some professional groups. The\\narts and crafts have been mentioned in the later Vedic texts. Archaeological findings also support\\n94\\nthis argument. We hear of smith and smelters, who had certainly to do some thing with iron –\\nworking from about 1000 BCE. A larger number of copper – hoards (consisting of copper tools)\\nhave been discovered in western UP and even in Bihar. These hoards belong to the phase of\\nOchre Colour Pottery (OCP) ware. The OCP ware phase has been assigned prior to 1000 BCE.\\nThese copper tools might suggest the existence of copper – smiths in both Vedic and non-vedic\\nsocieties. In any case copper was one of the first metals to be used by the Vedic people. The\\npottery made out of this metal was praised highly in the Vedic rituals. A large number of copper\\nobjects have been found in PGW sites. They were used mainly for war, hunting and also for\\nornaments.\\nLeather-work, pottery-making, carpenter’s work and above all weaving made great\\nadvance in this period. It seems that the later Vedic people were acquainted with four types of\\npottery- Black and Red Ware, Black Slipped Ware, Painted Grey Ware and Red Ware. However,\\nthe most distinctive pottery of the period is known as Painted Grey Ware. Glass hoards and\\nbangles have also been found in the PGW phase. These findings suggest some arts and crafts in\\nthem as well. Jewel workers are also mentioned in the later Vedic texts. They might have catered\\nto the needs of the affluent sections of the later Vedic society.\\nMortimer Wheeler believes that the PGW phase culture witnessed a full fledged urban\\nlife. The term nagara occurs in an Aranyaka and Nagrin in two Brahmanas. But these texts\\nbelong to a period not earlier than 600 BCE. The study of PGW settlements clearly indicates that\\nthe PGW phase of culture does not warrant its characterization as urban. The excavations at\\nHastinapur and Kausambi show the faint beginnings of towns towards the end of the later Vedic\\nperiod. They have rightly been called as proto urban sites. Some later Vedic texts refer to the\\nseas and sea-voyages. This shows that the rise of new-arts and crafts resulting in petty –\\ncommodity production stimulated some kinds of trading and commercial activities. But the\\nbarter – based and backward agrarian economy could not provide congenial atmosphere for the\\ngrowth of full fledged urbanization during this period.\\n7.5.4 Later Vedic Polity\\nOn the political horizon we witness some vital transformation during this period. The\\npopular tribal assembles lost their significance. The monarchical power increased at their cost.\\nThe Vidatha, which functioned as distributive tribal organization, disappeared during this period.\\nEven the Sabha and the Samiti lost their egalitarian and participative character. They were now\\nbeing dominated by rising chiefs and ritualistically powerful Brahmanas. Women were no longer\\nallowed to sit on the Sabha or function as distributive officials. The pastoral, booty capture,\\nsemi-nomadic and tribal society of the Rig Veda was transformed into a peasant (although small\\nscale) and territorial society. Though princes still ruled over the tribes, but their dominant tribes\\nbecame identical with territories, which might be inhabited by tribes other than their own.\\nInitially Panchala was the name of a people, and then it became the name of a region. Thus the\\ntribal name became the name of a territory. The earlier practice of electing the chief or king was\\ngradually relegated to the background. The Rig Vedic voluntary gift popularly called bali, which\\nthe tribal chief used to receive from the vis now had been transformed into a mandatory tax. Thus\\nthe beginnings of tax collection are found in this period. The powerful rising class of priestly\\nideologues namely Brahmanas developed mechanism of complex rituals to establish the fiscal\\n95\\nand administrative control over the peasantry. The Satapatha and the Aitareya Brahmanas\\nstrongly condemn the vis or the peasants who looked down upon the ruler, disobeyed and\\nrevolted against him. The Satapatha Brahmana suggests that the vis or the peasants should not be\\nplaced above the nobility, and that those who made the peasantry equal to the nobility and thus\\nmade them refractory caused confusion between the nobility and the peasants. The Aitareya\\nBrahmana says that the vis or the peasantry are grasses and the nobility is the deer. The grasses\\nare always meant to be eaten by deer. The Satapatha Brahamana suggests that the peasantry must\\nbe surrounded by the brahmanas from the one side and the kshatriya from the other. It is clear\\nfrom the several Vedic references that vaisyas were for more numerically stronger than the\\nbrahmanas and kshatriyas. Thus, the need arose to control them and forced them to pay\\nperiodical tithes or taxes to the ruling classes. But it is surprising to notice that the later Vedic\\ntexts do not refer to any extablished administrative mechanism for collecting taxes. The term\\nbhagdugha is interpreted not in the sense of tax collector but distributor. Thus we have no clear\\nidea about the nature of the taxes collected from the peasants. Inspite of the use of precious\\nmetals such as gold and silver, the later Vedic society was a non–monetary society in which\\ntaxes had to be collected only in kind. This was due to the limited availability of agricultural\\nsurplus on account of pre-field wooden ploughshare based agriculture in this period. Thus, it was\\na small scale non-monetary peasant society.\\n7.5.5 Later Vedic Society\\nThe Varna hierarchy emerged as one of the salient features of social formations in the\\nlater Vedic times. During the Rig Vedic period the varna description was probably initially\\nprimarily between the Aryan and non Aryan original inhabitants. But in the later Vedic period,\\nthe system expanded and clearly divided into four fold varna groups wherein the brahmana\\nclaimed the first rank and the shudra was pushed to the fourth and last rank. The brahmanas,\\nwhich claimed the highest rank, were earlier merely one of the seventeen kinds of priests. The\\norigin of this dynamic priestly rank is shrouded in mystery. D.D. Kosambi has argued that it may\\nhave included representations of the practitioners of Harappan culture as well as other\\nindigenous tribal priestly class. The birth of two most important Vedic risis such as Vasistha and\\nAgastya being regarded as born from jar also testifies to this kind of argument. Whatever may\\nhave been the reason of the emergence of this class it is beyond doubt to state that the Brahmanas\\nnot only overshadowed the other priestly groups but other categories of varnas as well. It seems\\nquite possible that with the advance of the agriculture, surplus produce became available to\\nsupport non-producing classes such as the Brahmanas, rajanyas and some other fast emerging\\nprofessional social groups. The Brahmanas invented numerous complicated rituals which\\nprovided ideological legitimization for the rajanyas or kshatraiyas to rule over the vaishyas and\\nshudras. In reward to this ideological support, Brahmanas claimed substantial shares in the\\navailable social surplus. The study of the later Vedic texts and particularly the Brahmanas texts\\nclearly indicates that this priestly class performed several ritual ceremonies not only for the\\nrajanyas or ksatriyas but for the huge mass of peasantry as well. By performing ritual ceremonies\\nfor vaisya class (the main producing class) they earned substantial amount of dakshina. The\\nroyal ceremonies and rituals such as rajsuya, asvamedha, vajapeya etc., fetched them huge\\namount of gifts. These gifts include hundred thousand of cows (their horns covered with gold)\\nthe horses, clothes, maid servants and even in some cases grains as well. Thus, the brahmanas\\nestablished themselves economically in an advantageous position. They had easy and direct\\n96\\naccess to the kings and at the same time maintained ritualistic relations with the vaisyas. In the\\nback drop of rising power of monarchy with its territorial identity and advance in field-\\nagriculture (though restrained by some technological constraint) created atmosphere for the\\nconflict between these two dominant classes of the later Vedic period. Several echoes of these\\nconflicts are mentioned in the later Vedic texts. The Atharavaveda warns the rajanyas or\\nKstariyas even about the touching of the cows and wives of the brahmanas. It refers to horrific\\nconsequences of such acts committed by earlier Ksatriyas. So they are suggested not to even\\nimagine to injure the property of the brahmanas. Nevertheless, we find references to real\\nconflicts between these classes. Possibly the priestly claim to highest social and ritualistic status\\nwounded the vanity of the fast emerging powerful monarchial class i.e. rajnyas or kshatriyas. But\\nthe most important factor seems to be economic i.e. the sharing of the surplus grain and cattle\\nmade available by the Vaisyas or peasantry. As the conflict became serious towards the end of\\nthe later Vedic period, the latest Vedic texts, particularly the Satapatha Brahmana found it\\nnecessary to emphasize unity and cooperation between the kshatriyas and brahamanas. The\\nAitareya Brahmana even warns them of being overwhelmed or over powered by the huge mass\\nof peasantry if they are not united. It says that the brahmanas and kshatriyas are the two vital\\npillars of the society and they must be united to uphold the social order. It seems that the\\nperpetual need of collecting tributes and sacrificial fees from the peasantry supplemented by the\\ndemand for the services of the shudras kept the two upper social classes together. But the focus\\nof social conflict seems to be limited to the relation between kshatriyas and the vaisyas.\\nThe vaisyas constituted the bulk of the population and they were assigned the producing\\nfunctions such as agriculture, cattle breeding and even limited trading activities. It seems that the\\nshudras at this point of time were numerically not so significant. They helped vaisyas in their\\nproducing functions and served brahmanas and kshtariyas as domestic servants. But the latest\\nlater Vedic texts particularly the Brahmana texts refer to their worst status in the society. The\\nAitareya Brahmana refers to the shudras as being the servant of another, to be compelled to work\\nat will by another, and above all to be beaten at will.\\n7.5.6 Later Vedic Religion\\nSome significant transformations or changes took place in the religious spheres during\\nthis period. The later Vedic times witnessed the inventions and practices of complicated series of\\nsacrifices involving a large number of rituals associated with them. In the changed socio-\\neconomic scenario two outstanding Rig Vedic gods, Indra and Agni, lost their former glory and\\nwere relegated to the background. Now, the Prajapati the creator, came to occupy the\\nunchallenged supreme position in the later Vedic religious horizon. Some of the insignificant\\ngods of the Rig Vedic period now became powerful. Rudra, the god of animals, become\\nimportant during this period. The nomadic god Vishnu was now transformed into a prominent\\npreserver, protector and sedentary god in the later Vedic times. Some gods were even\\ncategorized on the basis of varna, hierarchy. For instance, the Maruts were referred to as the\\ngods of peasantry and the Pusan was associated with the shudras. The mode of worship changed\\nconsiderably during this period. Sacrifices occupied the epicenter of religion. They assumed\\npublic as well as private character. Sacrifices involved the killings of animals on a large scale\\nand, especially the destruction of cattle wealth. We hear some protests against this practice in the\\nUpanishads. But this happened towards the end of the later Vedic period.\\n97\\n7.6 Conclusion\\nAround 600 BCE, the Upanishads were compiled. These philosophical texts criticized the\\nrituals and laid stress on the value of right belief and knowledge. The Vedic people spread to\\nKoshala and Videha.

These cultures refer to the cultural remains found in the\\nMegaliths and from the habitation sites associated with them.\\n8.1.1 The Term ‘Megalith’\\nThe term ‘megalith’ is derived from Greek ‘megas’, which means great and ‘lithos’\\nmeaning stone. As the nomenclature suggests, the ‘megaliths’ refer to the monuments built of\\nlarge stones. But all monuments constructed of big stones are not megaliths. The term has a\\nrestricted usage and is applied only to a particular class of monuments or structures, which are\\nbuilt of large stones and have some sepulchral, commemorative or ritualistic association except\\nthe hero stones or memorial stones. In other words, the megaliths usually refer to the burials\\nmade of large stones in graveyards away from the habitation area.\\n8.2 Chronology\\nMegalithic cultures in India (including North India) have been roughly assigned to a\\nprehistoric period or to a great antiquity by different scholars like M.H. Krishna, R.S.\\nPanchamukhi, G.S. Ghurye, Panchanan Mitra and others. But their dating is not considered to be\\nbased on well-observed archaeological data. So, this dating is generally countered by the\\narchaeologists.\\nThe problem of chronology of these cultures has evaded a clear solution. R.E.M.\\nWheeler, for the first time, on the basis of excavations at Brahmagiri provided a firm\\narchaeological setting for megalithic cultures in South India. Based on archaeological evidence,\\nhe places these cultures between the 3rd BCE and the 1st century CE. But the limits prescribed by\\nWheeler on the basis of Brahmagiri evidence are unconvincing. Megalithic culture of South\\nIndia had a much larger chronological span than what Wheeler could visualise over five decades\\nago. Similarly, B.K. Thapar, on the basis of his excavations at Maski, assigned the megalithic\\nculture in South India from circa 200 BCE to the middle of the 1st century CE with a reasonable\\nmargin of a century on either side.\\nThe problem in ascertaining the chronological span of the megalithic cultures in South\\nIndia lies in the fact that only a few radiocarbon dates are so far available from megalithic\\nhabitations. The habitations site at Hallur gave a C-14 date of 1000 BCE for the earliest phase of\\n101\\nthese cultures. Nagaraja Rao correlated this phase with the graves at Tadakanahalli, 4 kilometers\\naway from this site. S.B. Deo gives two radiocarbon dates for the sites at Naikund and Takalghat\\nand places Vidarbha megaliths in circa 600 BCE. In Tamilnadu, Paiyampalli recorded a C-14\\ndate of circa 4th century BCE. A. Sundara, on the basis of his explorations and excavations,\\npushed the date of the megaliths in North Karnataka region as early as 1200 BCE.\\nAs the megalithic culture overlapped with the end phases of Neolithic-chalcolithic\\nculture, it is found in association with Neolithic-chalcolithic wares at the lower end and with the\\nrouletted ware at the upper end. In other words, the late phase of these cultures merges with the\\nearly historical period. On this basis the time bracket of the megalithic cultures in South India\\nmay be placed between 1000 BCE and 100 CE. This view is supported by many scholars like K.\\nRajan. However, the available archeological data suggests that the period of their maximum\\npopularity lies somewhere between 600 BCE and 100 CE.\\nIt is interesting to note that in other parts of the world, for example England, France, Iran\\nand Seistan, such sepulchral monuments of the dead were constructed through this period and are\\nnot identical in all the countries.\\n8.3 Origin and Spread of Megalithic Cultures\\nThe megalithic monuments are among the most widespread remains of humans, both in\\ntime and space. The origin of the most megalithic monuments is placed in the Mediterranean\\nregion in the early Neolithic period. From here this culture is said to have been carried by traders\\nwho went in search of metals along the Atlantic coast to Western Europe, and from the Aegean\\ncoast into Southern Europe through Greece. Its spread was in criss-cross pattern, carrying\\ndifferent cross currents across the whole of Europe. In the context of India this culture arrived\\nwith the Dravidian speakers who came to South India from west Asia by sea.\\nThe fieldwork undertaken by various scholars since the last century has opened a new era\\nin the study of South Indian megaliths. However, understanding the origin, diffusion, authorship,\\nchronology and material culture of the megalithic period is a complex problem. These megaliths\\nhave been found in different chronological context practically all over India, from the plains of\\nPunjab, Indo-Gangetic basin, the desert of Rajasthan northern part of Gujarat and especially all\\nregions south of Nagpur in the Peninsular India. It survives as a living tradition in the north-\\neastern part of India and in the Nilgiris.\\nDifferent theories have been put forward regarding the origin and diffusion of the\\nmegalithic cultures. Scholars, by and large, unanimously look forward to a West Asian origin.\\nAccording to C. von F. Heimendorf, the megalithic folk of South India were the Dravidian\\nspeakers who came to South India from the West by sea. But we find that the typical West Asian\\nmegaliths yielded the bronze objects and this culture came to an end in the last phase of their\\nBronze Age around 1500 BCE. The Indian megaliths, on the other hand, belong to the Iron Age\\ngenerally dated to 1000 BCE onwards. It is yet not certain when and how iron technology\\ndeveloped and became an integral part of the megalithic culture. It appears that even the advent\\nof this metal into Indian subcontinent was through two routes and also with two groups. The\\nmaterial and chronological differences between the megalithic culture of northern India and\\n102\\nsouthern India suggest that the coming of this culture into the Indian subcontinent would have\\ntaken place by two routes by the two different groups – one following the sea route from the Gulf\\nof Oman to the West coast of India and the other following the land route from Iran. Asko\\nParpola in his book The South Indian Megaliths connects the megaliths with the vrtyas of the\\nAryan origin who are referred to in the Vedic literature. But it can be observed that the complex\\npattern of widely different burial practices that are all lumped together and comprised in the term\\n‘megaliths’ is the result of mingling of various traditions and developments during a long period.\\nMoreover, the limited explorations and excavations conducted so far generally concentrated in\\nsome geographical zones do not provide tangible conclusions about the origin of the megalithic\\ntraditions.\\nThe early part of the 19th century witnessed the studies on the megaliths of Kerala with\\nthe discovery and excavation of a few burials in the Kannur district by J. Babington in 1823.\\nSubsequently, several British administrators and many other individuals explored and excavated\\na large number of megaliths, and brought their findings to the notice of people. But they were\\nmainly interested in the grave goods found in the megaliths and some of them even related the\\nmonuments with the local legends and folk tales. Later on, in 1887 scholars like W. Logan\\ncarried the study of the megaliths further. Since the publication of J.W. Breeks in 1837 on the\\nmegalithic monuments of the Nilgiris, the megalithic monuments of Tamilnadu have attracted\\nthe attention of many antiquarians, archaeologists and the institutions alike on account of their\\ncurious and imposing structures. But the systematic investigations of the South Indian megaliths\\nbegan only in 1940s. Scholars like R.E.M Wheeler (1947), B.K. Thapar (mid-1940s) and V.D.\\nKrishnaswami (1949) studied the megaliths at Brahmagiri (Karnataka), Porkalam (Kerala) and\\nCochin (Kerala) regions respectively and enriched our knowledge about megalithic phase.\\nR.E.M. Wheeler dated the megaliths on the basis of a characteristic ceramic (pottery) type – the\\nBlack and Red Ware (BRW), which is available in all types of megaliths in South India. V.D.\\nKrishnaswami studied the unknown megaliths of the Cochin region systematically for the first\\ntime in India and classified them into distinct types and also defined them in unambiguous term.\\nHe also standardized the terminology for megaliths. Thus, the confusion in the nomenclature of\\nthe megaliths was brought to an end. In recent years, scholars like B.K. Gururaja Rao, A.\\nSundara, K. Rajan, Rajan Gurukkal, P. Rajendran, C.S.P Iyer and others have illuminated us\\nthrough their researches on the megaliths of different regions in South India.\\nThe main concentration of the megalithic cultures in India was the Deccan, especially\\nsouth of the river Godavari. However, large-stone structures resembling some of the usual\\nmegalith types have also been reported from some places in North India, Central India and\\nWestern India. These include – Seraikala in Bihar; Deodhoora in Almora district and Khera near\\nFatehpur Sikri in Agra district of Uttar Pradesh; Nagpur; Chanda and Bhandra districts of\\nMadhya Pradesh; Deosa, 32 miles east of Jaipur in Rajasthan. But since neither the excavation\\nnor a reliable surface-examination of these monuments has so far been carried out, it is difficult\\nto say if and how far they are connected with the megaliths of the Deccan. Similar monuments or\\nstructures are also found near Karachi in Pakistan, near Leh in the Himalayas and at Burzahom\\nin Jammu and Kashmir. However, their wide distribution in the southern region of India suggests\\nthat it was essentially a South Indian feature which flourished at least for a thousand years,\\nresulting in a variety within the underlying megalithic unity of common origin.\\n103\\n8.4 Megalithic Culture – The Iron Age Culture of South India\\nIn the present state of research, these megalithic monuments, whatever their external\\nshape and contents be, seem to herald the Iron Age in South India. The megalithic culture in\\nSouth India was a full fledged Iron Age culture when the great benefits of the use of this metal\\nwere fully realised by the people. Hence, normally the stone dropped out of use as a material for\\nthe weapons and tools to a large extent. The megalithic people of South India, or, for that matter,\\nthe Iron Age people of the subcontinent in general, found out new uses of stones in their daily\\nlife. Most of the information about the Iron Age in South India comes from the excavations of\\nthe megalithic burials. Iron objects have been found universally in all the megalithic sites right\\nfrom Junapani near Nagpur in Vidharba region (Central India) down to Adichanallur in\\nTamilnadu in the far south.\\nWith the introduction of iron, there was a gradual change in almost everything except\\nperhaps the house plans. But, of all these changes the most remarkable was the elaborate method\\nof disposing the dead. This became a characteristic feature of the South Indian regions. Instead\\nof laying the dead accompanied by four or five pots in a pit in the house, now the dead were\\nburied in a separate place – a cemetery or a graveyard away from the house. The remains of the\\ndead were collected perhaps after exposing the body for sometime and then the bones were\\nplaced underground in specially prepared stone box called a cist. The cists were elaborate\\nstructures and must have necessitated an amount of planning and cooperation among the\\ncommunity and the existence of masons and other craftsmen capable of manufacturing the\\nrequired size of stones, large and small. It is probable that like Egyptian cellars, these megaliths\\nmust have been planned and kept ready before the death of an individual.\\n104\\n(Source: V.K.

State whether true or false:\\n(i) Megalithic cultures refer to the cultural remains found in the Megaliths and from the\\nhabitation sites associated with them.\\n(ii) All monuments constructed of big stones are megaliths.\\n(iii) The problem in ascertaining the chronological span of the Megalithic cultures in South\\nIndia lies in the fact that only a few radiocarbon dates are so far available from megalithic\\nhabitations.\\n(iv) Scholars, by and large, unanimously look forward to a West Asian origin of the\\nMegalithic cultures.\\n(v) The main concentration of the megalithic cultures in India was the Deccan, especially\\nsouth of the river Godavari.\\n105\\nB. Name at least five sites and also the types of megalithic structures discovered at those\\nwhich represent the megalithic culture of South India.\\n8.5 Classification of the Megaliths\\nIt is not easy to prepare a typology of the megaliths of South India in general because the\\nmegalithic burials show a variety of methods for the disposal of the dead. Moreover, there are\\nmegaliths which are internally different but exhibit the same external features. Nevertheless, on\\nthe basis of the explorations and excavations carried out on different sites of South India, the\\nmegaliths can be classified under different categories depending upon their outstanding features.\\nThese are:\\nI. Rock Cut Caves,\\nII. Hood Stones and Hat Stones / Cap Stones,\\nIII. Menhirs, Alignments and Avenues,\\nIV. Dolmenoid Cists,\\nV. Cairn Circles,\\nVI. Stone Circles,\\nVII. Pit Burials, and\\nVIII. Barrows\\n8.5.1 Rock Cut Caves\\nThese are scooped out on soft laterite, as found in the southern part of the West Coast.\\nThese rock cut cave tombs are peculiar to this region and occur in the Cochin and Malabar\\nregions of Kerala. They also occur in other regions. On the East Coast of South India, they are\\npresent in Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram) near Madras. In the Deccan and western India they\\nare observed at Elephanta, Ajanta, Ellora, Karle, Bhaja etc. But these belong to a later date and\\nwere used for entirely different purposes while those in Kerala are purely megalithic and\\nfunerary ones, the others being of different tradition.\\nThe Kerala funerary rock cut caves consist of an open well, roughly rectangular or\\nsquare, cut vertically down the rock and provided with a flight of steps for descending to the\\nfloor. Such caves are found at many sites like Chovvannur, Kakkad, Porkalam, etc. More\\nelaborate specimens of such caves occur at sites like Eyyal, Kattakampal, etc.\\nOn the basis of his detailed study of these rock cut burial caves in Cochin region, Y.D. Sharma\\n(1956) recognises four types of caves – (i) Caves with Central pillar, (ii) Caves without central\\npillar, (iii) Caves with a deep opening and (iv) Multi-chambered caves.\\n8.5.2 Hood Stones (Kudaikallu) and Hat Stones / Cap Stones (Toppikkals)\\nAllied with the rock cut caves but of a simpler form are the Hood stones or Kudaikallu.\\nThese consists of a dome-shaped dressed laterite block which cover the underground circular pit\\ncut into a natural rock and provided with a stairway. In some cases the hood stone gives place to a\\n106\\nhat stone or toppikkal, which is a plano-convex slab resting on three or four quadrilateral\\nclinostatic boulders, forming a square base and a truncated top on which rests the toppikkal or the\\nhat stone. This also covers an underground burial pit containing the funerary urn and other grave\\nfurnishings. Unlike as in the rock cut caves, there is no chamber apart from this open pit in which\\nitself the burial is made. Usually, it contains a burial urn covered with a convex or dome-shaped\\npottery lid or a stone slab and contains skeletal remains, small pots and, sometimes ashes. Similar\\nmonuments are commonly encountered in Cochin and Malabar regions extending along the\\nWestern Ghats into the Coimbatore region upto the Noyyal river valley in Tamilnadu.\\n8.5.3 Menhirs, Alignments and Avenues\\nMenhirs are monolithic pillars planted vertically into the ground. These may be small or\\ngigantic in height, ranging from 14 to 16 ft. down to a mere 3ft. Their common heights range\\nbetween 3 to 6 feet. They are often rudely dressed or not dressed at all. These are essentially\\ncommemorative stone pillars set up at or near a burial spot. These menhirs are mentioned in\\nancient Tamil literature as nadukal and are often called Pandukkal or Pandil. In some cases, the\\nmenhirs are not planted in ground but rest on the original ground propped up with a mass of\\nrubble as at Maski. These occur in a number of sites in close vicinity of other type of megalithic\\nburials, mostly in different regions of Kerala and Bellary, Raichur and Gulbarga regions of\\nKarnataka in large numbers, but less frequently at other places of South India.\\nAlignments are closely associated to the menhirs. These consist of a series of standing\\nstones, oriented to the cardinal directions. Some of these stones are 14 to 16 ft. high and one\\nmonolith at a certain place measured 25 ft. long. But the normal heights range between 3 and 6\\nft. These stones are sometimes dressed. The alignments are found at Komalaparathala in Kerala\\nand at a number of sites in Gulbarga, Raichur, Nalgonda and Mahboobnagar districts of\\nKarnataka.\\nAvenues consist of two or more parallel rows of the alignments and hence many of the sites\\nin the Deccan, mentioned above under alignments, may be considered as examples of this category\\nof monuments when they are in parallel lines.\\n8.5.4 Dolmenoid Cists\\nDolmenoid cists consists of square or rectangular box-like graves built of several\\northostats, one or more for each side, supporting the superincumbent capstone consisting of one\\nor more stones, often with the floor also paved with the stone slabs. The orthostats and the\\ncapstones might be formed either of undressed rough blocks of stone or partly dressed flattish\\nstones. The dolmenoid cists occur in large number at Sanur near Chingleput and many other sites\\nin this region. The cists built of dressed slabs or the slab cists are the normal type of cists,\\noccurring all over South India, as also in some parts of the north. There are many sub-types of\\nthis in Tamilnadu – (i) Dolmenoid cist with multiple orthostats, (ii) Dolmenoid cist with four\\northostats planned contra-clockwise with U-shaped port-hole in the east or west, (iii) Dolmenoid\\ncist with four orthostats kept contra-clock-wise with U-shaped port-hole on the top corner of the\\neastern orthostat, and (iv) Dolemnoid cist with four orthostats arranged contra-clockwise and\\nwith slab-circles.\\n107\\n8.5.5 Cairn Circles\\nThe Cairn circles are one the most popular type of megalithic monuments occurring all\\nover south India in association with other types. They consist of a heap of stone rubble enclosed\\nwithin a circle of boulders. On the basis of the form of the underground burial, they may be\\ndivided into three sub-types – (i) Pit burials, (ii) Sarcophagi burials, and (iii) Pyriform or other\\ntypes of urn burials.\\nThe pit burials under the cairn circles consist of deep pits dug into the natural soil, roughly\\ncircular, square or oblong on plan. The skeletal remains and the grave furniture were placed on the\\nfloors of these pits. The pits were then filled up with earth, either the earth dug up in the pit or that\\nwhich was brought from elsewhere, upto the original ground level. Above this earth filling was\\nplaced the cairn heap which might be just a thin layer or may rise upto 3 to 4 ft. above the ground\\nlevel and bounded by a circle of stones. Such pit burials have been found at many sites in the\\nChingleput (Tamilnadu), Chitradurg and Gulbarga (Karnataka) districts.\\nA sarcophagus is literally a legged coffin made of terracotta. The cairn circles containing\\nsarcophagi entombments are comparatively more widespread than the pit burials. They are\\nsimilar to the pit burials described above but the skeletal remains and the primary deposits of the\\ngrave furniture are placed in an oblong terracotta sarcophagus. This sarcophagus is generally\\nprovided with a convex terracotta lid, rows of legs at the bottom and often with a capstone at a\\nhigher level. Rarely, these sarcophagi are not provided with legs, but are supported on pottery\\nstands and vessels or placed on the floor directly. Such megalithic structures are found from\\nSouth Arcot, Chingleput and North Arcot districts of Tamil Nadu and Kolar district of\\nKarnataka. They are also found in the southern districts of Andhra Pradesh, though they are\\ncomparatively rare in these regions.\\nThe urn burials under the cairn circles are a variant form of the sarcophagi burials\\ndescribed above and occur in large number in most parts of South India. The urns, in which the\\nburials are made, are deposited in pits dug into the soil. The pits are filled up with the soil upto\\nthe ground level and are frequently provided with a capstone. Then, the heap of cairns on the\\nsurface, which marks the burial, is surrounded by a circle of stones. They are predominant in\\nKerala and have been known to occur is Madurai, Tiruchirapalli, Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Salem,\\nChingleput and South Arcot district of Tamil Nadu; Kolar, Banglore, Hassan, Chitradurg,\\nBellary, Raichur and Gulbarga districts of Karnataka; various districts of Andhra Pradesh and the\\nregion around Nagpur in Maharashtra.\\n8.5.6 Stone Circles\\nThey are the most commonly encountered megalithic monuments in India. They reflect the\\nfeatures of various forms of megalithic monuments such as the Kudaikallu, Topikkal, different\\ntypes of pit burials, menhirs, dolmenoid cists of different types, cairns, etc. These occur from the\\nsouthern tip of the peninsula upto Nagpur region and in different parts of North India, where the\\nmegalithic monuments are known to occur. But in this category under consideration, only stone\\ncircles without any considerable cairn filling within the circle, containing burial pits with or\\n108\\nwithout pyriform urns or sarcophagi, are included. The monuments under this category are\\ndistinguished from the cairn circles only in that the cairn heaps occur or do not occur in these\\ncircles. Otherwise, all the three sub-types discussed above under the cairn circles are found to\\noccur in this category also. It may appear that there is not much justification in making this\\ndistinction between cairn circles and stone circles. But at some sites like Sanur near Chingleput,\\nboth the kinds exist side by side, but in separate groups. Therefore, on the basis of some\\ndistinctions they are placed under different categories under our considerations.\\n8.5.7 Pit Burials\\nBurials in pyriform or fuciform urns, large conical jars or handi-shaped jars containing\\nthe funerary deposits, are buried in the underground pits specially dug for the purpose into the\\nhard natural soil and sometimes into the basal rock and the pits are filled up. In these kinds of\\nburials we do not find any surface indication of the burial in the form of a stone circle, cairn\\nheap, hood stone or hat (cap) stone, or even a menhir. These urn burials are without any\\nmegalithic appendage. But in some sites like Amritamangalam in Chingleput district some small\\nheaps of earth mixed with quartz chips would make out the place of the burial. Strictly speaking,\\nthis class of megalithic burials cannot be included under the megalithic burial monuments,\\nbecause no megalithic or, for that matter, any lithic appendage in the form of stone circle or\\ncapstone is observed in relation to them. But they exhibit the general traits of the megalithic\\nculture of South India, characterized by the use of the typically megalithic Black-and-red ware\\n(BRW) and associated wares with iron objects. These grave goods are identical typologically\\nwith their counterparts found in the regular megalithic burials. Moreover, these occur in the\\ngeneral areas where the typical megalithic burials exist. In fact, these urn burials do not differ in\\nany detail from the urn burials under a stone or cairn circle of the megalithic order, except for the\\nsurface features. These urn burials without megalithic appendage are found in many sites of\\nTamil Nadu like Adichanallur, Gopalasamiparambu and scores of other sites, practically in\\nalmost every village in Madurai, Tiruchirapalli, Coimbatore, Salem, and South Arcot districts.\\nHowever, these occur less abundantly in Karnataka and Andhra regions. Even in North India,\\nthese urn burials are frequently observed at a number of Harappan and the Later Chalcolithic\\nsites in Western, Central and North-western India, but their context is completely different from\\nthe South Indian urn burials. But the latter might have had some phylogenetic (racial affinity)\\nconnection with the former.\\n8.5.8 Barrows\\nThe barrows or earthen mounds mark off the underground burials. They may be either a\\ncircular or a round barrow, oblong or oval on plan, a long barrow. They have or may not have the\\nsurrounding stone circles or ditches. Monuments of this kind have not been found in large numbers in India.\\nHowever, such monuments have been observed in the Hassan district of Karnataka.\\\\\\n109\\n(Source: V.K. Jain, Prehistory and Protohistory of India, 2006)\\nCheck your progress exercise 2\\nA. Identify the following:\\n(i) These are scooped out on soft laterite, as found in the southern part of the West Coast.\\n(ii) They consist of square or rectangular box-like graves built of several orthostats.\\n(iii) These are monolithic pillars planted vertically into the ground.\\n(iv) They are the most commonly encountered megalithic monuments in India.\\n(v) Burials in pyriform or fuciform urns or large conical jars or handi-shaped jars containing\\nthe funerary deposits, and buried in the underground pits.\\n110\\n8.6 Grave Goods in Megalithic Burials\\nThe megalithic burials have yielded a variety of objects, which prove to be very\\nimportant for us in the study of megalithic culture. It is observed that right from the Later\\nPalaeolithic period, an intentional burial was accorded to the dead for manifold motives. The\\nmegalithic people were no exception to the age-old custom and, therefore took pains to construct\\nelaborate and much labour-consuming tombs. They furnished them with as many essential\\nobjects as they could afford. They thought this practice to be necessary as they believed in after-\\nlife of the dead. And so, the dead were suitably provided for a place to live in with goods of their\\nessential needs.\\nIn the Indian megalithic especially those in South India, the grave furniture consisted of a\\nlarge variety of pottery; weapons and implements mostly of iron but often of stone or copper;\\nornaments like beads of terracotta, semi-precious stones, gold or copper, shell, etc., strung into\\nnecklaces or rarely the ear or nose ornaments, armlets or bracelets and diadems; often food as\\nindicated by the presence of paddy husk and chaff, and some other cereals; skeletal remains of\\nanimals, sometimes complete in these graves.\\n8.7 Subsistence Pattern\\nA detailed analysis of the available archaeological, archaeobotanical and\\narchaeozoological data recently by U.S. Moorti (1993), and their correlation with certain\\nenvironmental factors indicates an agro-pastoral base for the megalithic period of South India,\\nwith other crafts coming to the fore and all plausibly intertwined in a symbiotic relationship with\\neach other. Now let us discuss the sector-wise developments illuminating the subsistence pattern\\nduring the period.\\n8.7.1 Agriculture\\nThe basis of the economy during the period of megalithic phase was agriculture. In fact,\\nthe megalith builders were responsible for the introduction of the advance methods of agriculture\\non a large scale, based on irrigation. Scholars like E.H. Hunt and N.R. Banerjee have observed\\nthat the megalithic builders introduced the ‘tank-irrigation’ in South India and thus brought a\\nrevolutionary change in the agricultural system. Their statement is based on the circumstantial\\nevidence that the megaliths are concentrated invariably on the slopes of the hills or on elevated\\nground, which are not suitable for irrigation as they do not encroach upon arable lands. Some of\\nthe megaliths which seem to be on the edge of the tanks in the summer season are virtually\\nsubmerged in water during the rainy season. However, one can argue that the embankment, if at\\nall, was man-made. Was the water stored in it sufficient for cultivation? Some of the sites are on\\nthe river banks. Does this mean that megalithic people were harnessing the river water for\\ncultivation? Further, some of the sites are in thick forest. Neither is there any land for irrigation\\nnor any tanks in these regions. There are many sites where there are no tanks.\\nOn the basis of the above evidence, B. Narasimhaiah opines that the megalithic builders\\nwere not the people who introduced ‘tank-irrigation’ in South India. Of course, it is a well-\\nknown fact that even from the prehistoric times humans settled where there was perennial water\\n111\\nsource for their sustenance. The tanks therefore might have been natural ponds, which supplied\\nwater for their daily needs, but not for irrigation. However, most of the scholars believe that\\nthese tanks supplied water for their household life and to their crops. The tank-irrigation system,\\naccording to them, was definitely introduced into South India by the megalithic builders and it\\nhas lasted for more than 2500 years, till the present day.\\nThese highly intelligent and pragmatic communities were to see that the fertile arable\\nlands were not wasted from encroachments by their graves. Unproductive foot-hills, rocky and\\ngravelly lands were used for the location of their graves, while lower down, the plains were\\nreserved for agricultural purposes. But they seem to have considered that the spirit of their dead\\nancestors would not only guard but also bestow prosperity on their fields and hence, located\\nmassive though empty dolmens in the midst of their fields at Uttaramerur in Chingleput district\\nof Tamilnadu.\\nRice, an essentially irrigational crop, served, no doubt as their staple food. Paddy husks and\\nrarely paddy grains are reported from a number of excavated graves from all over the region. Rice as\\nattested by the Sangam literature, is the staple food of the people of South India since very early\\ntimes and remains till today. The archaeobotanical evidence indicates the cultivation of other crops\\ntoo such as Ragi, Navane, Wheat, Kodo millet, Barley, Hyacinth bean, Horse gram, Black gram,\\nGreen gram, Common pea, Pigcon pea, Grass pea, Jobs tears, Indian jujube, Goosefoot (Fathen),\\nLentil, Cotton, etc. in the megalithic period of South India.\\n8.7.2 Pastoralism\\nScores of megalithic sites have yielded evidence of the remains of the domesticated\\nanimals like cattle, sheep/goat, dog, pig, horse, buffalo, fowl, ass, etc. On the basis of the\\nanalysis of these faunal remains at different sites, it is inferred that cattle (including buffalo)\\npredominates over other domesticated species at these sites. Invariably, in all these sites it\\naccounts for nearly more than 60% of the total faunal assemblage. This brings out two important\\nfacts. First, the earlier Neolithic tradition of cattle keeping was continued and second, cattle\\npastoralism and not sheep/goat pastoralism, formed a major preoccupation of megalithic society.\\nThe occurrence of the remains of domesticated pig and fowl suggests pig rearing and\\npoultry farming on a small scale at many of the sites.\\n8.7.3 Hunting and Fishing\\nHunting naturally augmented the food supply, as the equipment for hunting, like arrowheads,\\nspears and javelins would indicate. Sling was probably another equipment used for hunting by\\nmegalithic people, as attested by the large scale findings of stone balls. The occurrence of\\nskeletal remains of wild fauna like Wild boar, Hyena, Barking deer, Chousingha, Sambar, Chital,\\nNilgai, Peacock, Leopard, Tiger, Cheetah, Sloth bear, Wild hog, Pea fowl, Jungle fowl, Water\\nfowl, etc. from different sites indicate that these species were hunted and obviously formed part\\nof their dietary system. Even now, many of these wild species are found in and around the areas.\\n112\\nThe evidence in the form of terracotta net sinkers from Takalghat and fish-hooks from\\nKhapa and Tangal besides the actual skeletal remains of fish from Yelleshwaram reflect that\\nfishing was also practised by the megalithic folk.\\n8.7.4 Technology: Industries and Crafts\\nFor the fulfilment of other societal needs in domestic, technical and cultural fronts an\\nefficient infrastructure of subsidiary economic activities is essential. The industrial activities\\nsuch as smithery, carpentry, pottery making, lapidary, basketry and stone cutting which formed\\nother economic activities of megalithic society, are dealt here mainly because of the\\ninterdependent link between these and the primary methods of production.\\n\\uf0b7 Metals\\nThere are many megalithic sites which in all probability were the production sites of metals\\nlike iron, copper, gold, silver etc. The available archaeological evidence in the form of crucibles,\\nsmelting-furnaces, clay tuyers and presence of material like iron ore pieces, iron slag, copper\\nslag and traces of ancient copper, gold mines or the mineral resources at or near to these sites is\\nsuggestive of smithery. The available archaeological evidence indicates the utilisation of metal\\nimplements such as axes, phoughshares, hoes, sickles, spades, etc. The use of axe was either for\\ncutting logs or for clearing forests. The use of hoe (or bladed harrow) for cultivation has been\\nrecorded at many sites. This particular implement resembles the modern bladed harrow, known\\nas “kunte” in Kannada and “gunlaka” in Telugu. The use of ploughshare from many sites amply\\nattest to the technological base of megalithic people for carrying out the agricultural operations.\\nA recent study (1986) also highlights a wider knowledge of agricultural technology attained\\nduring the protohistoric and early historical India.\\nIron was the metal used predominantly to produce weapons of different shapes and for\\ndifferent purposes, tools and implements for agricultural purposes and everyday household\\nneeds. The rich variety of iron objects enables us in understanding the aspects of their economy\\nand their way of life to a large extent. These objects reflect that agriculture was their primary\\noccupation as a large number of iron tools necessary for agricultural activities arefound at\\ndifferent sites. Copper was used for the production of vessels and ornaments. The ornaments\\nwere also made of gold. The use of silver was rather scarce. Though Adichannallur burials and\\nNilgiris yielded bronze objects the use of bronze at these two sites are exceptions and it is rather\\ndoubtful if these were locally manufactured.\\nAn efficient utilisation of metallic resources is dependent upon another crucial factor and they are\\nthe availability of fuel and type of fuel capable of producing the required degree of temperature.\\nPerhaps the most common type of fuel used by these pre-industrial smelters were charcoal, wood\\ndung and paddy husk.\\n\\uf0b7 Woodcraft / Carpentry\\nA wide variety of technomic items viz., those related to woodcraft indicates another skilled\\nprofession practised by megalithic people. The evidence shows that the axes, chisels, wedges,\\n113\\nadzes, anvil, borers, hammer stones, etc., formed the main tool-kit for working on the wood. The\\narchaeobotanical evidence from megalithic sites show that the information regarding some of the\\nplant species like Acacia, Pinus, Brassica, Stellaria, Teak, Satinwood etc. were already known to\\nthese communities. The use of wooden plough for cultivation cannot be set aside as suggested by\\nM.K. Dhavalikar and G. Possehl. Even now, the tillage implement common in black cotton soil\\ntracts, is the country wooden plough, which is large and very heavy.\\nThe woods were also used for posts in the construction of huts with thatched or reed roofs\\nsupported on wooden posts. Postholes are observed at Brahmagiri and Maski indicating the\\npresence of timber constructions for domestic buildings. Some scholars like S.B. Deo suggest an\\nadvance stage of wooden architecture involving dressing of wood and creating different types of\\nmortice holes either for interlocking or for tenons. The common occurrence of these technomic\\nitems suggests ample use of wood for construction and many other purposes.\\n\\uf0b7 Ceramics (Pottery)\\nThe ceramic fabrics associated with the megalithic culture are Black-and-Red Ware (BRW),\\nBurnished Black Ware, Red Ware, Micaccous Red Ware, Grey Ware, Russet Coated Painted\\nWare (RCPW), etc.\\nBRW, which is a wheel-turned pottery, essentially consists of utilitarian shapes and a majority of\\nthe forms probably served as tableware of megalithic society. The prominent shapes encountered in\\nthis ware are varieties of bowls, dishes, lids or covers, vases, basins, legged jars, channel-spouted\\nvessels and conoids.\\nThe burnished black ware, which is also wheel-turned, comprises some prominent shapes\\nsuch as elongated vases, tulip-shaped lids, funnel-shaped lids, goblets, spouted vessels, circular\\nring-stands, knobbed and rimmed lids with bird or animal finials.\\nIn red ware the shapes are strictly utilitarian which include legged vessels, double knobbed\\nlids, ring-stands, dough plates and vases.\\nOf all the types, the most attractive are the RCPW with wavy lines and other decorations.\\nThey are occasionally bearing post-firing graffiti. Russet-coated jars are recovered from several\\nsites.\\nThe micaccous red ware exhibits typical shapes like pots with globular body and funnel-\\nshaped mouth, dough plates and basins. Decorations in the form of cordings, applique and\\npainted designs have also been noticed.\\nAll these varieties of pottery are characterised by a fine fabric and are produced from\\nwell levigated clay rarely with sand or such gritty material. They were generally well fired in\\nopen kilns at low temperature. R.E.M. Wheeler opines that possibly the pottery were turned on a\\nslow wheel.\\n114\\nThe evidence of pottery kilns from at least two sites, viz., Polakonda and Beltada Banahalli can\\nbe taken as supportive evidence for the practice of this craft. Although, the above evidence at both\\nthese sites comes from late Neolithic levels, a continuation in the habitational deposit bearing\\nmegalithic levels may help us to assume so. A wide variety of shapes in different fabrics to serve\\nas tableware for eating and drinking purposes and cooking utensils and the technical efficiency\\nevident in the preparation of these ceramics or potteries might hint at a professional class of potters\\nand pottery making as one of the important economic activities.\\n\\uf0b7 Miscellaneous (Bead making, Mat weaving, Stone cutting, Terracotta making, Rock\\nart, etc.)\\nA number of objects ranging from single terracotta beads to very finely manufactured gold\\nornaments were used by the megalithic folk for their personal decoration. The locational\\noccurrence of some of the megalithic sites in resources zones, and the evidence of bead making\\nindustry attested at two megalithic sites –Mahurjhari and Kodumanal, are suggestive of the\\npractice of this craft. The availability of a large variety of beads show that agate, carnelian,\\nchalcedony, feldspar, coral, crystal, garnet, jasper, tremolite, magnesite, faience, paste martz,\\nserpentine, shell, steatite, amethyst and terracotta were utilised in the preparation of beads of\\ndifferent exquisite shapes. Apart from the use of semi-precious stones, some of the shapes have\\nalso been worked on precious metals like gold, shell, horn, bone and glass.\\nThe mat impressions left on the base of jars at sites like Managondanahalli and\\nNagarjunakonda indicate that the art of mat-weaving was known and practised.\\nThe activity of stone-cutting is attested by the chisel impressions noticed at Borgaon Khurd\\n(Maharashtra) on a stone trough, excellent laterite cutting evidenced in rock-cut chamber tombs\\nof Kerala region, the field observation by A. Sundara in the construction pattern of chamber\\ntombs in North Karnataka and also the occurrence of domestic stone artefacts such as pestles,\\nmortars, saddle querns, etc., at many megalithic sites.\\nTerracotta discs, figurines, gamesman, miniature pottery vessels found from graves attest\\ntheir use as toys for entertainment of children. The most remarkable is the terracotta disc\\nresembling spindle-whorls, which was probably used in hop-scotch game. This is suggested by\\nthe discovery of a disc in the grave of a child.\\nScholars like S.P. Tampi, Y. Mathpal and K.J. John, on the basis of the engravings and\\npaintings on the rock-shelters in peninsular India, argue that these megalith builders were the\\nauthors of these paintings. There is evidence in Sangam literature also of the erection of burial\\nstones with paintings as well as writings. But, unless direct dating of the pigments from the\\npainting is done, the antiquity and authorship of these paintings cannot be ascertained.\\nThus, we can say that the megalithic people practised a highly specialised agro-pastoral\\neconomy. The divergent economic patterns, which seem to have prevailed then, as is the case\\neven now, were not isolated but had a symbiotic relationship with each other.\\n115\\n8.8 Trade and Exchange Network\\nThe excavations have yielded various non-local items among the grave goods which\\nreflect that there were exchange activities during the megalithic period. According to R.N. Mehta\\nand K.M. George, carnelian beads reported from coastal sites, which were points of exchange in\\nancient times, direct us to the presence of trade activities. Similarly, the availability of bronze\\nsuggests the arrivals of copper and an alloy, either tin or arsenic, from somewhere. From the\\nGraeco-Roman writings and the Tamil texts it is clear that at a little later period maritime\\nexchange was the major source for procuring them. The archaeological remains like the rouletted\\nware, amphora and other ceramic materials found at many sites like those at Arikamedu are\\nevidence for this. Scholars like H.P. Ray, Rajan Gurukkal, R. Champakalakshmi and others have\\nalready shown that inter-regional and intra-regional exchange of goods were fairly well\\nestablished in South India by the 3rd. B.C. Regional variation in the production of commodities\\nand the non-availability of local raw materials/finished goods had set in long-distance\\ntransactions under the initiative of the long-distance traders from the Gangetic region as well as\\nthe overseas world. The exchange network which was in an incipient state during the early Iron\\nAge expanded over the centuries as a result of internal dynamics and external impetus involving\\nthe demand for goods in other parts of the subcontinent as well as the Mediterranean region.\\nMany scholars including B. Morris, S. Gupte and D. Stiles opine that it was a network across\\nland and seas with long-distance traders in the middle and unevenly developed people at either\\nside. Thus, the megalithic people as the hunter-gatherers and shifting cultivators of Iron Age also\\nhad active participation in the exchange network.\\n8.9 Social Organisation and Settlement Pattern\\nIt is not archaeology but anthropology, which provides us evidence to assume the\\npossibility of production relations transcending clan ties and kinship in such remote periods of\\ntribal descent groups. By and large they point to the material culture of diverse forms of\\nsubsistence such as hunting/gathering and shifting cultivation besides the production of a few\\ncraft-goods, which have been discussed in the previous section (“Subsistence Pattern”) of this lesson.\\nThough there was commonality in the idea of megalithism and the associated\\nassemblages, the variations observed in the external and internal features of the burials reflect\\nthat the Iron Age society of the megalithic people was not a homogenous entity. Some of the\\nrelatively huge burial types are suggestive of status differentiation and ranking of the buried\\nindividuals as discussed earlier. Differences in the types and contents of the burials suggest that\\nthere was some sort of disparity in the attributes of the buried individuals. The number of more\\nelaborate burials like the multi-chambered rock-cut tombs at many sites, are limited. Moreover,\\nthese have yielded rare artefacts made of bronze or gold. On the other hand, many of the burials\\nare simple urn burials with a very few artefacts. The variety, high quality and fineness of ceramic\\ngoods in huge burials including the elaborate urn burials, are also suggestive of the difference in\\nsocial status. The studies on the megalithic society of South India by scholars like J.M. O’shea\\nand U.S. Moorti generally assume that “an individual treatment at death bears some predictable\\nrelationship to the individual’s state in life and to the organisation of the society to which the\\nindividual belonged”.\\n116\\nThe megalithic people lived in villages consisting of a sizeable population. Though they\\nhad a bias for the urban life, they were slow in building huge cities like their contemporaries in\\nthe Gangetic Valley. The size of the population is indicated by the organised mass of manual\\nlabour that was available for transporting and housing massive blocks of stone in the\\nconstruction of cists, dolmens and other types of megaliths, or in erecting large rubble and\\nearthen mounds across the water courses for storing up rain waters for irrigational purposes. The\\nlarge size of population is further attested by the fact that extensive burial grounds with\\nnumerous graves, many of them containing the remains of more than one individual, and\\noccasionally of as many as 20 or more individuals, have been found.\\nThe houses in which the megalithic people lived probably consisted of huts with thatched\\nor reed roofs, supported on wooden posts as indicated by the presence of postholes in the\\nexcavated sites. At Brahmagiri and Maski were found postholes indicating the presence of timber\\nconstruction for ordinary buildings. Some scholars like S.B. Deo suggest an advance stage of\\nwooden architecture during the megalithic period.\\nAn increase in the size and number of settlements during megalithic period from the\\npreceding Neolithic/chalcolithic phase and growing use of different metallic resources was\\ncertainly not an independent development. This can be perceptively observed, as Sheratt (1981)\\nargues in the effect of the spread of plough cultivation which produced major alterations in the\\nstructure and distribution of settlements. Although it is difficult to substantiate this point further\\nin the absence of studies concerning land-use patterns during the megalithic period. However, an\\nanalysis of the available data by U.S. Moorti on the locational context and the distribution\\npatterns of these sites strongly indicate a growing inclination towards intensive-field method. He\\nsuggests village transhumance on the basis of the location of most of the settlement sites either\\non the banks of major rivers or on their major tributaries and that of most of the burial sites\\nwithin a distance of 10-20 km from major water resources. The maximum concentration of sites\\nin river valleys and basins and preference shown towards occupying black soil, red sandy-loamy\\nsoil zones also supports this contention. The distribution pattern of these sites in rainfall zones\\nwhere the average annual precipitation is 600-1500 mm, also hints to the same conclusion.\\n8.10 Religious Beliefs and Practices\\nThe elaborate architecture of their graves, the grave goods and other metal and stone\\nobjects throw light on the religious beliefs of megalithic people. The megalithic people had great\\nveneration for the dead as they constructed these monuments with great effort and devotion.\\nThey believed that the dead had a life after death and the living had to provide them with their\\nnecessities. The grave goods indicate that they belonged to the dead man in life and since they\\nwere required for his/her use in the other world, they were buried along with the mortal remains.\\nAll these certainly reflect that the ‘cult of the dead’ had a strong hold on the people. The grave\\ngoods represented the affection and respect of the living for their dead.\\nTheir belief in animism is reflected in animistic cults. This is evident by the occurrence of\\nanimal bones of domestic animals like cattle, sheep/goats and the wild animals like wolf in the\\nmegaliths. It seems that these animals were killed for the funeral-feast and the skeletal remains\\nwere buried in the graves, or they were sacrificed and buried in the graves to supply food for the\\n117\\ndead. Animism is also reflected by terracotta figurines of animals decorated with garlands and\\nornaments.\\nSangam literature, which is contemporaneous with the end phase of the megalithic culture\\nin South India, also throws light on the different methods of disposal of the dead prevalent among\\nthe megalithic people. Many of the earlier beliefs continued during the Sangam age. So, we may\\nassume that the religious practices referred to in the Sangam literature reflect, to an extent, those\\nthat prevailed among the megalithic people. The tradition of associating stone with the dead has\\nsurvived in South India till late times and the herostones or the Virakal or the Mastikal are\\nexamples of this.\\n8.11 Polity\\nThe differences in the size of the monuments and the nature of the grave valuables\\nreflecting differentiation in status and ranking, also suggest the nature of contemporary political\\npower. The construction of a huge monument involving the mobilisation of substantial collective\\nlabour implies the power of buried individual to command it.\\nIn the light of the fact that the contemporary people were tribal descent groups,\\nanthropologically we may assume the prevalence of chiefly power, i.e. chiefdoms. The chief was the\\ngreat son of the descent group. The Late phase of the megalithic cultural coincides with the Early\\nhistorical period as reflected by the excavation at many sites. So, the Sangam works also help us in\\nunderstanding the period. The chief of the tribal group is referred to as perumakan (great son) in the\\nliterary texts. He commanded the entire personal, material and culture resources of his clan. This\\nattests that these elaborate burials probably were of the chiefs or descent heads. The tribal pattern of\\nthe distribution of power was simple and involved no hierarchy, though the chiefs, their heirs and\\nwarriors had a privileged status. However, this differentiation in status was too flexible to be made\\nout as a stratification.\\nThere is no theoretically plausible evidence showing the existence of a class-structured\\nsociety anywhere in South India even by the mid-first millennium A.D, which is the upper date\\nnow ascribed to the megaliths. Therefore, the remarks of some scholars about the existence of\\ntribal descent groups as a stratified society with aristocrats seems inconceivable. The period of\\nthese huge monuments hardly crosses the last two or three centuries before Christ. This period\\nwitnessed numerous small chiefdoms co-existing and contesting against one another and\\nanticipating the emergence of big chiefdoms by the turn of the Christian era. As Rajan Gurukkal\\nhas shown, the people under big chiefdoms also were in a social organisation based on clan kinship\\nties and a complex system of redistribution. From the references in Tamil heroic texts like\\nPurananuru, it is evident that even the big chieftains, who had enjoyed prestigious status among\\nmany other chieftains, were also given urn burials. So, in a way all burials including the most\\ncommonly seen urn burials represent individuals or groups with some status and ranking as\\nheadmen or kinsfolk. Thus, it can be assumed that even urn burials were of chiefly type.\\nSometimes memorial stones (natukal) were erected over the urn burials of great chiefains and\\nwarriors. However, the huge multi-chambered rock-cut tombs are not mentioned anywhere in the\\nliterary texts, probably because the practice of erecting such elaborate burials must have become\\nuncommon by that time.\\n118\\nSome of the chiefdoms must have been bigger depending upon their human strength,\\nresource control and exchange relations. This is testified by the prestige goods and varieties of\\nceramics and other artefacts found in the graves.\\nThe megalithic people had been interacting and exchanging material and cultural goods with\\none another. There was need-oriented and use-value based interaction at the level of clans. But at the\\nlevel of chiefs it was competitive and hence combative process of plundering raids, both inter-clan\\nand intra-clan, led by chiefs for predatory control. This led to subjugation of one chief by the other\\nwhich in turn helped the emergence of bigger chiefs and the formations of bigger chiefdoms. These\\narmed fights among the clans must have resulted in the death of many chiefs and warriors. Probably,\\nthis was the reason for erecting numerous sepulchral monuments during the megalithic period. This\\nalso accounts for the emergence of the cult of heroism and ancestral worship. Through armed\\nconfrontation and predatory subjugation the cultural and political power of a few chiefdoms became\\nmore evolved over the years and they emerged as bigger chiefdoms. The Tamil heroic texts represent\\nthe phase of bigger chiefdoms. From this we can infer that the last phase of the megalithic period\\nwhich is contemporaneous to the Sangam period, marked the march towards bigger chiefdoms.\\n8.12 Legacy of the Megalithic Culture\\nIt is interesting to note that megalithism is still alive amongst different tribes in India, for\\nexample the Maria Gonds of Bastar in Madhya Pradesh, the Bondos and Gadabas of Orissa, the\\nOraons and Mundas of Chotanagpur region now in the state of Jharkhand, and the Khasis and\\nNagas of Assam. Their monuments, which are of a memorial nature, include dolmens, stone-\\ncircles and menhirs. The North-east Indian megalithic culture seems to have a South-east Asian\\naffiliation rather than the western influence.\\nIn South Indian context, the remnants of megalithism among the Todas of Nilgiris are very\\nsignificant. The account of M.J. Walhouse regarding the funeral customs of this primitive tribe reflects\\nthe surviving burial practices that were followed by the megalithic people. It helps us in understanding\\nthe probable customs that existed among the now extinct megalithic builders of South India. The\\nexisting burial practices of the Todas include many common features of the megalithic burials with\\ngrave goods including food items and the use of stone circles to mark the place of the burial.\\n8.13 Limitations of the Sources for the Study of Megalithic Culture\\nThe major problem that comes in our way of studying the megalithic culture is the form\\nin which the sources are available to us. Firstly, as almost the whole of our evidence is collected\\nfrom the burials, the knowledge about the conditions and methods of their everyday life is\\nnecessarily limited to the evidence supplied by their grave furniture and the various inferences\\nthat can be drawn from the observation of the architecture of the graves and connected\\nconsiderations. The literary evidences which include the accounts of Graeco-Roman writers and\\nthe ancient Tamil texts (Sangam literature) have their own limitations as their period marks the\\nend phase of the megalithic culture. Secondly, vertical digging in excavations of different\\nhabitation sites with aim to unfold the cultural sequence of these sites provides us with evidence,\\nwhich is scantly and limited in nature. And, on the basis of these evidence it is hazardous to\\ngeneralise about their cultural attainment. Though scrappy, the evidence obtained by these\\nexcavations nevertheless enables us to build a tentative picture of the megalithic culture.\\nMoreover, the lack of settlement remains associated with the burials is the frequently raised issue\\n119\\nin the context of the peninsular Indian megaliths. Due to the absence of habitation sites in\\nregions like Kerala, the analysis of the settlement pattern of the megalithic culture has become a\\ndifficult task. The settlement sites could have provided a variety of evidence in addition to the\\nstratigraphic data for separating periods of various culture strands, thus, making the\\nreconstruction of the cultural history of megalithic people more illusive.\\nThus, the megaliths of South India reflect a series of questions, answers to which are still\\nshrouded in mystery. In his very recent writings B. Vidyadhara Rao (2000) has even questioned\\nthe authenticity of the megaliths as a burial. The issue still requires more investigations. Let us\\nhope that the future researches on the subject would illuminate us with a more confirmed and\\nclear image of the megalithic culture.\\n8.14 Conclusion\\nSumming up the above discussion, we can say that the megalithic culture in South India\\nwas gifted with dynamic people, who almost revolutionised the society of the earlier Neolithic-\\nchalcolithic times. They depended heavily on agriculture to sustain a considerably large society,\\nthough hunting and fishing supplemented their food supply and various industries and crafts\\nenriched their economy. It becomes amply clear that the megalithic people practised a mixed-\\neconomy based on agro-pastoral production. They had a bias towards the urban life but were\\nslow in building up huge cities unlike their contemporaries of the Gangetic valley, where well-\\nestablished cities had been flourishing since the 6th-5th centuries B.C. They were essentially a\\nseparate and more group of dynamic people than the other iron age folk in India. The cult of the\\ndead became the dominant feature of their religion and life, which survives in the culture of\\nmany tribes till today.\\nCheck your progress exercise 3\\nA.
