🔍 Project Overview
This project is a full-stack implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates:

OCR-based image query input,

FLAN-T5 model for natural language reasoning,

FAISS-based vector similarity search for document understanding.

It allows users to upload PDFs or images, extract meaningful content, ask intelligent questions, and get concise, structured answers — all in an elegant Streamlit UI.
